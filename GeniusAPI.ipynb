I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample. That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb. She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burning, we smoking. My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing. She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around. In the small of my back in case some shit go down. Right under my Hermes,. I'm hearing the word is. Me, I'm a P.I.M.P. I let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some. Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done. Niggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout. Police coming, you like, put this shit out. You like smoke and you got me high. (You make a nigga want to get down). High. (High feeling like I'm up in a cloud). Girl, what the fuck you done to me?. You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me. You're like smoke and you got me high. (So high make your love come down). High. (One time, have that ass turnt out). Girl, what the fuck you done to me?. You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me. You're like smoke. Shawty hot, she full blown, she hot now. 100 degrees, that's with or without the top down. But when she get to working her hips you know the temperature rise. You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me. It's complicated, my occupation pimping ain't easy. Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks. Back when I was pumping crack, now my cards are black. Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs. If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs. Luther said it: a house is not a home without her. I had them panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder. But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits. Her wanting is temporary cause for sure she gon' get it. \"},\n",

On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit. Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch. And then you die, but for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick. Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but. Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher. We paid the price to circle us, success ? they turned my mic up. I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up. If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged. Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches. If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?. What, shorty? (Where you disappear to, son?). Maintaining. Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in,. ill streets' blues got you hunger panging. Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singing, fool. To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks. No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit. '95 South. Papi on the Hill. And all the towns like Cambridge. And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with. Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit. These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?. What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?. The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch. I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop. Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot. Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got. Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot. Y'all feel me, enough to stop the illing right?. But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight. I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now. I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now. It's just once in a blue. And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through. I get to zoning: me and this chick on the L and then we're boning. I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning. Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man. \"},\n",

I got a sense of direction and a compass. Com passed MC's with no compassion, though I heard the screams of. But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort?. Com should have been at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill. But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals. Now Com could get the penny, but I want my own company. And Com is on a mission not to work for commission. It's a common market and it's so much competition. But to me, competition is none. To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot. My compact disc is a commodity, so buy it. Instead of competing with Pete. Com compromised, Com made a promise. Not to commercialize, but compound the soul.

Trying to make this thing right. And having one of my co-workers say \"Yo, you look just like. This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night\". Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes. No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows. I had all that snatched from me. A&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me. And didn\\'t want to hear a rap from me. So naturally actually had to face things factually. Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me. Cause nothing\\'s there, nothing\\'s fair. I don\\'t want to ever go back there. So I won\\'t be taking no days off \\'til my spaceship takes off. [Hook]. I\\'ve been workin\\' this graveshift and I ain\\'t made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. I want to fly, I want to fly. I said I want my chariot to pick me up. And take me, brother, for a ride. '},\n",

If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold. Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for a O. For the millionth time asking me. Questions like Wendy Williams, harassing me. Then get upset when I catch feelings. Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave. While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve. Uggh, nice watch. do you really have a spot?. Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?. Eses. down by Pico with Frederico. I answer all y'all questions but then y'all got to go. Now the question I ask you is how bad you want to know? BLAOW!. 98 Primo remix and ain't nothing different. I don't kow what the hell niggas been sniffing. Four days out the week find me in the kitchen. Still in the game nigga, hooked like glue. Papi gave me one pie, but it cook like two. I'm a crook like you. Cats around my way was buying brand new whips and shit, what could I do?. Knowing I'm supposed to style. I'm the hustler's poster child, Rock lizards and crock-a-dile. Live ironic and what-not. Put all that ice on the face of a watch just to make it hot. Now you see me on them stages. Rocks in the air looking like blue lasers, never fugazis. Act courageous, I smack 'em with the two aces. Mack double one. All I got for chicks hard dick and bubble gum. Flip bricks like Fred, Barney Rubble and them. It's the Rock-A-Fella clique, what's fucking with them?. Not a damn thang nigga, we doin our damn thing.. BLAOW!!!. Well they call me Jay-Hova cause the flow is religious. And ever since I was 16 I was holding digits. I'm seeing this industry clearer. As if I had coke in the trunk and cops in the rear mirror. I slow flows y'all to death, so y'all ho's know who's best, Jigga!!. The flow be Ay Bendito, for the mamis I hable espa?ol poquito. I got timing like a segue. In the darkest nights let off my gun for light. To guide y'all through, show you how it's done. I'm the question and the answer like Iverson. Jets be private ones, no gate to lift. So when I take flight it's from Hangar 6. I put one in your frame picture that. who's running the game. Let's get to that I guess we one and the same. A million and one... once again. Like a baller in an Impala Jigga remain low. kick off like soccer. In a Range Rove. I hit y'all with a million more. \"},\n",

I\\'m the one who\\'s doing it while these other niggas talk about it. And if motherfuckers come at me wrong. I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome.

Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools. You know the rules. Lil' Caesar go ask your homie how I'll leave you. Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased. Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's. Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets. So fuck peace! I'll let them niggas know it's on for life. Don't let the Westside ride the night. Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed. Fuck with me and get your caps peeled. [Hook: 2Pac]. Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac. Call the cops when you see 2Pac. Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish. Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace. Nigga, I hit 'em up. Check this out, you motherfuckers know what time it is. I don't know why I'm even on this track. Y'all niggas ain't even on my level. I'm going to let my little homies ride on you bitch-made ass Bad Boy bitches. [Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]. Get out the way, yo, get out the way, yo. Biggie Smalls just got dropped. Little Moo' pass the MAC . and let me hit him in his back. Frank White needs to get spanked right for setting traps. Little accident-murderer, . and I ain't never heard of ya. Poisonous gats attack when I'm serving ya. Spank you, shank your whole style when I gank. Guard your rank cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint. Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm running through, nigga. And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga. With the ready-power. Tucked in my Guess . under my Eddie Bauer. Your clout petty/sour, . I push packages every hour. I hit 'em up. [Hook: 2Pac]. Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac. Call the cops when you see 2Pac. Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish. Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace. Nigga, I hit 'em up. Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel. This ain't no freestyle battle. All you niggas getting killed with your mouths open. Trying to come up off of me, you in the clouds hoping. Smoking dope, it's like a sherm high. Niggas think they learned to fly. But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die. Talking about you getting money, but it's funny to me. All you niggas living bummy ? why you fucking with me?. I'm a self-made millionaire. Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air. Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch. And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?. Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style. Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled. Now I'm back to set the record straight. With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate. Motherfucker, I'll hit 'em up. [Verse 4: Kadafi]. I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs. No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs. Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease. I'll bring you fake G's to your knees. Copping pleas in de Janeiro. Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?. Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up. What the fuck, is you stupid?. I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn. With my click looting, shooting and polluting your block. With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot. Outlaw MAFIA clique moving up another notch. And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped. [Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]. You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker. I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker. Softer than Alize with a chaser. About to get murdered for the paper. E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper. Like a loc . with Little Ceas' in a choke. Gun totin' smoke. . We ain't no motherfucking joke. Thug Life, . niggas better be known. Be approaching in the wide open, gun smoking. No need for hoping, it's a battle lost. I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is bopping off. [Outro: 2Pac]. Now you tell me who won. I see them, they run. They don't wanna see us. Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressing up trying to be us. How the fuck they gonna be the mob when we always on our job? We millionaires. Killing ain't fair, but somebody got to do it. Oh yeah, Mobb Deep: you wanna fuck with us?. You little young-ass motherfuckers. Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or something?. You're fucking with me, nigga. You fuck around and catch a seizure or a heart attack. You better back the fuck up. Before you get smacked the fuck up. This is how we do it on our side. . Any of you niggas from New York that want to bring it: bring it!. But we ain't singing, we bringing drama. Fuck you and your motherfucking mama. We gon' kill all you motherfuckers. Now when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie. Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfucking opinion. Well, this is how we gonna do this:. Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie, . fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfucking crew!. And if you want to be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!. Chino XL: fuck you too!. All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!. (Take money, take money). All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you; die slow, motherfucker. My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow!. You motherfuckers can't be us or see us. We motherfuckin' Thug Life-riders, . Westside til we die!. Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya. We'll bomb on you motherfucker! . We do our job!. You think you mob? Nigga, . we the motherfuckin' mob. Ain't nothing but killers and the real niggas. All you motherfuckers feel us. Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple. You niggas laugh cause our staff got guns under they motherfuckin' belts. You know how it is, when we drop records they felt. You niggas can't feel it, we the realest. Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy-killers. \"},\n",

Don\\'t take shit for granted and don\\'t take shit, give it\". Only bull you should take is by the horns. A mixture of Whitey Ford and Mighty Thor. I everlast, pen is mightier than sword. Finish writin\\', then record, replenish, keep writin\\' more. Nothing\\'s ridin\\' on it. but your pride, that\\'s all you\\'re fightin\\' for. So you bite, scratch, you claw, backs to wall. No one was there to catch you fall. You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off. You grab your balls like they\\'re gargantuan. And ask yourself how fuckin\\' bad you want it. Pull out your pass for whoopin\\' ass and flash it on \\'em. Nobody\\'s gonna back you in that corner,. you\\'re a hornet. No one\\'s more ignorant than you fuckin\\' four in the mornin\\'. You\\'re at the la-bor-atory. Stormin\\' like there\\'s nothin\\' that\\'s more important. Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin\\', you\\'re in for it.

Nobody wants to play. They say I\\'m a spoiled lil\\' baby, but.... Nobody puts a baby in the corner. I\\'m only tryna warn ya. Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin\\' a tantrum. He\\'ll fuckin\\' flip on ya. Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner. I\\'m only tryna warn ya. Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin\\' a tantrum. He\\'ll fuckin\\' flip on ya cause. [Verse 2]. What goes through an addict\\'s brain. Besides static pain. and Big Daddy Kane,. breakbeats and words?. An erratic train of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain, yeah. Maybe that explains why you\\'re back but you don\\'t rap the same. And you\\'re lookin\\' way thinner. Cause your hunger got you lookin\\' like they took away dinner. (Chicka) \"Sugar Ray\" Leonard. Wouldn\\'t sugar-coat a fuckin\\' booger though. Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker\\'s coat. When you say you\\'re a (chicka) what? (Chicka) GOAT. Now fling that bitch from your fingertips. Hope it lands on another rap singer\\'s lips who can\\'t think of shit. Anythin\\' of wit that\\'s interestin\\' to spit. Yo, who\\'s king of this fuckin\\' English lit?. Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin\\' this shit. How low can you go?. Lower then Chuck D, ho, hear the bassiness in my voice. Rocky\\'s back, where\\'s my Adrians?.

Who just happen to be on the crapper. When it happened, I had an epiphany in the bathroom. I\\'d never be the same after. Now I\\'m back with an appe-tite for destruction. And a fuckin\\' recipe for disaster. So let\\'s eat cause I\\'m famished, every deed is a dastardly one. Evilish bastard, even you askin\\' for me to be po-lite.

There\\'s nothin\\' on this fuckin\\' Earth. Better than bein\\' the king of the playground. I hate the swings, but I love bein\\' an underdog. Cause when I\\'m pushed, I end up swingin\\' (Ah!).

Tragedy, he used to come through all the time. I\\'m talking Juice Crew, not what the word define. He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine. That was my first crush; I bought my first mic. I wrote my first verse, I was about nine. I was about mine, fantasize house buyin\\'. Met Paul, he wore some big glasses. Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived.

G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill. But Fly Ty didn\\'t have the contract we wanted. Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn\\'t want us. Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted.

The rap world like, \"What\\'s all this commotion?\". Went plat, mad bottles I\\'m toastin\\'. 20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then?. Invincible, lyrical, miracle man. Uh, but back to the matter at hand. ?Cause 10 years ago we all strived to be 25. Some cats didn\\'t make it alive. Dated some stars but respect their privacy. Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver\\'s seat. Held myself down, just steering the wheel. Here I am, completed my whole record deal. '},\n",

Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger. One day, she put 911 on the pager. Had to call back, whether it's minor or major. No response, the phone just rung. Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem. When I pulled up, police was on the scene. Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean. Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes. Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes. It didn't take long before the tears start. I saw my bitch dead. with the. gunshot to the heart. And I know it was meant for me. I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me. And when I find 'em your life is to an end. They killed my best friend.... Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch. Just me and my, just me and my bitch, uh. Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch.

And you know you were their armor. And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her. But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?. What happens when you become the main source of a pain?. \"Daddy, look what I made!\", Dad\\'s gotta go catch a plane. \"Daddy, where\\'s Mommy? I can\\'t find Mommy, where is she?\". I don\\'t know, go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy\\'s busy. Daddy\\'s writing a song, this song ain\\'t gon\\' write itself. I\\'ll give you one underdog . then you gotta swing by yourself. Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her. And put hands on her mother who\\'s a spitting image of her. That\\'s Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady\\'s crazy. Shady made me, . but tonight Shady\\'s rocka-by-baby. [Hook]. And when I\\'m gone, just carry on, don\\'t mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice.

Baby, Daddy ain\\'t leaving no more, \"Daddy you\\'re lyin\\'. You always say that, you always say this is the last time. But you ain\\'t leaving no more, Daddy, you\\'re mine\".

It\\'s got a picture, \"this\\'ll keep you safe, Daddy, take it withcha\". I look up, it\\'s just me standing in the mirror. These fuckin\\' walls must be talking, ?cause man, I can hear \\'em. They\\'re saying \"You\\'ve got one more chance to do right\" ? and it\\'s tonight. Now go out there and show that you love \\'em before it\\'s too late.

But baby, wait, \"It\\'s too late, Dad, you made the choice. Now go up there and . show \\'em that you love \\'em more than us. That\\'s what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep screamin\\' your name. . It\\'s no wonder you can\\'t go to sleep. Just take another pill, . yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, . k-keep it real\". I hear applause, all this time I couldn\\'t see. How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?. I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it. Put it to my brain, scream \"Die, Shady!\" and pop it. The sky darkens, my life flashes. The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes. That\\'s when I wake up, alarm clock\\'s ringin\\'. There\\'s birds singin\\', . it\\'s Spring and Hailie\\'s outside swingin\\'.

Shadows are created by the light. We stickin' out our tongue, we never bite. See the vision when you're starin' in the flame. In this game of thrones, when you win you still lose. Cause your ego get insane when they cheerin' your name. Now your people face disease and famine. And fuck the king cause we famished. That's why the brothers that I roll with don't be waving no banners. Warriors for the cause and we raisin' a family. And when it's time to exact revenge. Have a son, come back from the dead. The protector of the realm and the citadel. Living in squalor while the rich people livin' well. I'm seein' they enjoying they seven Heavens. Almost like they forgot about the seven Hells. \"},\n",

Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive. That's why the universe sent me today on this stage. With this to to say. And in the final hour many heads will lose power. What does the rich versus the poor really mean?. Psychologically it means you got to pick your team. The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto. Let go, it's not a novelty. You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty. There's no reason to fear the New World Order. The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see. Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society. Stop the negativity and control our creativity. The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?. Could it be we still thinking like niggas?. Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger. Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!. \"},\n",

Teardrops and closed caskets, . the three strikes law is drastic. And certain death for us ghetto bastards. What can we do when we're arrested but open fire?. Life in the pen ain't for me, ?cause I'd rather die. I wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggas on welfare. And who cares if we survive? The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a four-five. And I swear it's like a trap. But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back. Hoes show me love, niggas give me props. Forever hop, ?cause it don't stop ? on my block. Living life is but a dream. Hard times is all we seen (on my block). Can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops. Fearing jail, but crack sales got me living well. Staying strapped, forever trapped in this drug life. God, help me, ?cause I'm starving, can't get a job. So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard. Mislead from childhood where I went astray. In my heart I felt alone, out here on my own. I close my eyes and picture home ? on my block. Living life is but a dream. Hard times is all we seen (on my block). Swollen pride and homicide don't coincide. Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes. All up and down the block, exterminating black life. But I can't blame the dealers; . my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels. Shit's real, I know you feel my tragedy. A single mother with a problem child, daddy free. Hangin out, picking up game, sippin' cheap liquor. Gaming the hoochies, hoping I can get to sleep with her. Fantasies of a nigga living phat but held back. Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless. Living life is but a dream. Hard times is all we seen (on my block). I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain. For all the niggas that I lost to the game ? from my block. Living life is but a dream. Hard times is all we seen (on my block). \"},\n",

Roosevelt House. Their green grass is green; our green grass is brown. Shots rang, my phone wasn't touch tone. Were heavy beef in the street, E.T. had to flee. Great heavens, good grief. Hungry bellies, bright gold on their teeth. The windows on the Ave look like sad eyes. They fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by. And if you dare to stand, you can see 'em cry. You can watch 'em scowl, feel 'em prowl. While they're steady sizing every inch about you. Fast math measuring what you amount to. The laughter, the screams. The numeral, the song of songs, the book of dreams. Ends don't meet where the arms can't reach. Mean streets,. even when it's free it ain't cheap. On-going saga, terminal diagnosis. Basic survival requires super heroics. No space in the budget for a cape. Assume you gotta fly by night to save the day. Crash-landings routinely happen. Some survive, others never rise from the ashes. Sabbath. Creates an Ecstatic and there you have it. From teenage love praying in tongue. Strange fruit. From hence I come, so here we go. Signs and wonders all along the road. Some lies open, some lies closed. Some stretchers role with no lies at all. Some riders don't know what they ridin' for. Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone. Wherever you ride, whatever your lane. This road called life is a beautiful thing. And we are alive in amazing times. Delicate hearts, diabolical minds. Revelations, hatred, love and war. And more and more and more and more. And more of less than ever before. It's just too much more for your mind to absorb. It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt. We can't be alive in no time but NOW. It's just another shot to the heart. It's just a sure shot in the dark. It's just another place in the stars. Hey! The Ecstatic. The temperature's rising everywhere. Spirits rise everywhere. It's just a sure shot to the heart. It's just a sure shot in the dark. It's just another place in the stars.

People in Cali, used to think it was earthquakes. But it seems, like I\\'m locked in hell. Lookin over the edge, but the R never fell. I tripped and slipped, cause my Nikes got gripped. Stand on my own two feet, and come equipped. Any stage I\\'m seen on, or mic I fiend on. I stand alone, and need nothin\\' to lean on. Going for self, with a long way to go. So much to say, but I still flow slow. I come correct, and I won\\'t look back. Cause it ain\\'t where you\\'re from, it\\'s where you\\'re at. I learn to relax in my room and escape from New York. And return through the wound of the world as a thought. Thinkin how hard it was to be born. Me bein cream with no physical form. Millions of cells with one destination. To reach the best part as life\\'s creation. Nine months later, a job well done. Make way, cause here I come. Since I made it this far I can\\'t stop now. There\\'s a will and a way and I got the know-how. To be, all I can be and more. And see, all there is to see before. I\\'m called to go back to the essence. It\\'s a lot to learn so I study my lessons. I thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me. I\\'m glad I listened when my father was rappin to me. they lived in caves. Exiled from the original man, they strayed away. Now that\\'s what I call hard times. I\\'d rather be here to exercise the mind. From knowledge to born back to knowledge precise. Across the desert, that\\'s hot as the Arabian. But they couldn\\'t cave me in, cause I\\'m the Asian. Reachin for the city of Mecca, visit Medina. Mind keeps traveling, I\\'ll be back after. I stop and think about the brothers and sisters in Africa. Return the thought through the eye of a needle. Not only there, but right here\\'s an apartheid. So now is the time for us to react. Take a trip through the mind and when you get back. Understand your third eye seen all of that. It ain\\'t where you\\'re from, it\\'s where you\\'re at. No more props, I want property, in every borough. Nobody\\'s stoppin me, because I\\'m thorough. Rhymes I make gimme real estate for me to own. Wherever I bless a microphone. Double-oh-seven is back and relaxin. On point and reactin, and ready for action. I\\'m so low key that you might not see me. Incognito, and takin it easy (ghetto). Quiet as kept on a hush hush. In front of a crowd, I get loud, there\\'s a bumrush. Be calm, keep a low pro and play the background. Hopin the whack rapper put the mic back down. So rip it, break it in half, go \\'head and slam it. Cause when it\\'s time to build I\\'m a mechanic. Of bondin and mendin, attachin and blendin. So many solos, there is no endin. People in my neighborhood, they know I\\'m good. From London to Hollywood, wherever I stood. Footprints remain on stage ever since. Sidewalks and streets, I leave fossils and dents. When I had sex, I left my name on necks. My trademark was left throughout the projects. I used to get rich when I played c-lo. When I rolled 4, 5, 6, they go, \"We know\". So I collect my cash then slide. I\\'ve got my back, my gun\\'s on my side. It shouldn\\'t have to be like that. I guess it ain\\'t where you\\'re from, it\\'s where you\\'re at. Even the (ghetto). I\\'m from the (ghetto). Worrrd up. Peace. '},\n",

My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces. Illegal world where squads hit the block hard. Ask my man Twin when he got bagged. That fucked me up, God. But shit happens for a reason; . you find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleedin'. You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you. Hit with a 2 to 4 is difficult. Wild on the streets, I try to maintain. Tight with my loot, ?cause hoes like to run game. Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit. I'm like a Jew, saving dough so I can big whip. Pushing a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet. No matter how much loot I get. I'm staying in the projects, forever. Jakes on the blocks we out-clever. If beef, we never separate and pull together. When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first. Try to react and get them motherfucking feelings hurt. My crew's all about loot; . fuck looking cute!. I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits. Puffin L's, laid back, . enjoying the smell; . in the Bridge getting down, it ain't hard to tell, you better realize. Open your eyes and get wise. \"},\n",

Move like a snake when I\\'m mad; and then my tail rattle. When I bust, parental discretion is a must. [Verse 4: Eazy-E]. Little did they know that I would be arriving. And it\\'s surprising, rocking it from where I been. In the trade where funky ass records are being played. Fuck the regular, yo as I get better the. Bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick. So I get \\'em hot, thinking they\\'re gonna get it. As they sit, rubbing their legs like a cricket. To you it may be funny, but. There\\'s no service of beef without money. So slip the C-note, and you can choke. On a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat. Foreplay to me ain\\'t shit. When you spread \\'em I\\'m ready,. then you can get the dick.

The streets was a mess, and they still are. But the game is the game, so let it begin. In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins. Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity. Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change. Knowing that he'll end up in a grave. It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans. Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting. Like the second is something we all have. Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath. I seen a boss take it out on his staff. Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath. Never seen a man making money while he mad. So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math. Now the third, you probably heard from MOP. They say use them rocks to make 'em envy. Envy, the cousin of jealousy,. They hate it, to see you celebrated. Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it. Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth. Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth. Want you to break em off, getting money it costs. For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off. Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat. It?s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street. It?s a dude that?s getting paid in full, cars and jewels. So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move. He is never full and he gon' want your food. Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule. The sixth is a fix that's in all of us. When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust. When the drawers go down, the guards go down. Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now. Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed. Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other. Greed is a mother, it?s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff.

The shit is painful though but ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo. All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both. Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours. But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have. Cause, one thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was. Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address. But I\\'d have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus. Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas. If someone ever moved \\'em from me, that you could\\'ve bet your asses. If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap \\'em. And although one has only met their grandma once, you pulled up. In our drive one night, as we were leaving to get some hamburgers. Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you. And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness. Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths. And I saw your headlights as I looked back and. I\\'m mad I didn\\'t get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad. So mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess. I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it \\'fore I\\'m dead. The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we\\'re crashing. So if I\\'m not dreaming, I hope you get this message. That I\\'ll always love you from afar cause you\\'re my ma. I guess, we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on. Maybe we took this too far. [Bridge: Nate Ruess]. I want a new life (Start over). One without a cause (Clean slate). So I\\'m coming home tonight. Well, no matter what the cost. And if the plane goes down. Or if the crew can\\'t wake me up. Well, just know that I\\'m alright. I was not afraid to die. Oh, even if there\\'s songs to sing. My children will carry me. Just know that I\\'m alright. I was not afraid to die. Because I put my faith in my little girls. So I never say goodbye cruel world. Just know that I\\'m alright. I am not afraid to die.

He said: L, when things ain't going so well. Don't give up, try harder. And never be afraid to make mistakes. And don't spend your cash foolishly, save your papes. Cause good things come to those who wait they turn. Stay concerned, cause it's a lotta papes to earn. And help those that's less fortunate than you. And stay true to whatever you do, until you're through. Yo, uhh. O.C.'s illin', I will never, ever bore you. O.C.'s illin', I will never, ever bore you. To rock like I do, it takes certain zest. I'm truly untouchable, like Elliot Ness. See, my word and verse is fly. One moment tranquil. Then the next minute it goes with the strength to kill. I can rock a party right, all night, just trust me. Not an MC out there who can touch me. Anywhere I go, young ladies, they rush me. When I'm on the mic, no way in hell you can hush me. My mere presence will leave you in awe. And when I'm through you too will call me pa-pa. Now is the time to settle this vendetta. Slicin' MCs like a Swiss-cheese shredda. If you don't like Swiss, then I cut you like chedda. Thick, slow and quick, great pain it will inflict. The beat's on time and the cuts all click. Elegant, never meant, I loves to invent. If you heard me say I rock, this is what I meant. I don't shriek, I speak, I could never be weak. I got the crowd overwhelmed with my rap mystique. I'm shrewd, never booed, I wear the MC crown. When I step in the place, MCs, they bow down. Suckas I will smash, they're not fit for the class. Yo, when we get on the mic, they break out like a rash. Cause my sonic, atomic MCs get moronic. Chillin' with Big L, we like: It's bionic. Charismatic, emphatic, bass has no static. Strungin' off the rhyme like a cocaine addict. Nothing but cheers, call O.C. the leader. Def rhyme writer, fake MC defeater. Girlfriend said you're sweet, but I'm sweeter. I'll slay any MC in this rappin' arena. Colossal. not a fossil. MCs are quite docile. Teach what I'm preaching, you can call me an apostle. Tall, not short, dog, and this is the sport. I'm a soldier with the mic, and I'm guarding my fort. And MCs are no bigger than my big toe. And I get higher rating than The Cosby Show. When I recite my rhyme, just for you, my friend. Big L, jump on this mic and flow once again. Yo it's L the Harlem. Check it out, bust it. Yo it's L, the Harlem pimp baby. For real. I got more dimes than that Sprint lady. And that's ill. Playa hatas be giving me harsh looks. But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks. Forget em all. Yo, it's L the Harlem pimp baby, just like I said. Right now, I'm going off the top of the head. It's me and O.C., we be low-key. Chillin' in the cribs, iced-out Roley. Chillin' with my man, his name is Phat Phillie. I'm about to get illy. L is a willy. The Blackout Rap Show. I'm cool like my man, Fat Joe. Chew MCs like tobacco. O.C. Who's the fatso? No, not O. MC pro-rap, I can rip the show. With my man Big L, that's right, we representin'. Name is O.C., I'll put my foot indent in. Inside your butt like a slut on the call. MC war. Mics I storm. My man Big E is on the back of the side. MCs, pull away before I crash your ride. And we chillin' on the show called the Blackout Rap show. O.C. and L could never be wack y'all. Uhh! Yeah, cuttin' MCs like Jason. hit the cats with a base-bat. \"},\n",

Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off. Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club. And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun. (Nigga what about yo' wife?. Nigga fuck my wife. I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life. And I'm trying to make it to the St. Andrew's door. Hey man) {*chk-chk-BOOM*} That's the sound of the Glock. Even DJ Houseshoes fucked around and got shot. tec. but Fat Father and Hex. Kuniva, you hurt?. These niggas is tripping. Where's Bizarre at?. Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wilding. Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling. This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing. Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying. caps is getting peeled. used her body as a human shield. I squeezed through the back door and made my escape. I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!. I'm on 7 Mile {*gunfire*} what the fuck was that?. Damn, somebody hit me from the back!. (What with they car?)With a gat nigga, and my tire flat. {*crash*} And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes. (Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove. It was a black Mitsubishi. Shit, that's the clique we beefing with. Maaaaan! (I swear). Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today. AK. tucked. I never seen no shit like this in my life before. People are still camped out from the night before. Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still. Trying to get inside the club to see. D12 perform. The fire marshals know, the venue's too small. People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd. Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off. Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away is the door. St. Andrew's. strays. Grazed one bitch in the face. Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off. Thank God I'm alive. Denaun. And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him. Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre. Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!. I never saw him run so fast in my life. Look at him hauling ass. I think he left his wife. There she is, on the ground, being trampled. I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her. I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it. It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it. I scoop Dee. follow Bizarre's path, ran through it. Swift. Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with. But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his. four-fifth. Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right. Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right. I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight. Although I can't stay here to fight cause I'm popping niggas tonight. That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge. Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in. Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck. That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker. So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show. The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of. Mo'). I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?. He tried to run, so. Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece. \"},\n",

Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive. The Q-45,. Glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit. Respect is collected, so check it. I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks.

My life is played out like a Jheri curl. I'm ready to die!. As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook. Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks. A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road. I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sewed. I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus. Getting paid is all I expected. My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?. Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck. Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel. I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal. Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep. Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet. The infrared's at your head real steady. Nah we ain't gonna kill your ass yet. We gonna make you suffer. In a sec, I throw the tec to your fucking neck. Everybody hit the deck,. Biggie bout to get some rec. Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talking. You better act like CeCe and keep on walking. When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat. You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete. Your face, my feet, they meet,. I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton. Biggie Smalls on a higher plane. Niggas say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain. Make your shit splatter. Mix the blood like batter then. my pocket gets fatter. After the hit. , leave you on the street with your neck split. Down your backbone to where your motherfucking cheek drip. The shit I kick, ripping through the vest. ready to die!. For ninety-three!.

Ayyo, my pockets was extra thick. \"So what you doin later, oh nothing, then lets catch a flick.\". Yeah, I bagged that ho well. Took her to the triple M, movies, meal, and motel. And when it comes to this I\\'m a professor. I didn\\'t molest her I caressed her, undressed her then sexed her. But I must be getting bolder. Cause I didn\\'t put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier. I started stickin up quick. And the next time I took a leak. A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick. Ayyo L these bitches be burnin? the dog shit outta niggas. Who you tellin? man? These bitches nowadays?d have a nigga dick drippin? lava. Man fuckin? with these hoes without a rubber nowadays is like bungee jumpin? with a rope around your neck. That?s like playin?, [laughter], that?s like playin? Russian roulette with a shotgun.

Want you here to witness me while you in misery. We hate each other but it's love. What a thug mystery. Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy. We enemies but your hatred could never enter me. Some seek fame cause they need validation. Some say hating is confused admiration. Spotlight on me. I still look twenty. Still get money, lady killer.

You know the song by Phil Collins. \"In the Air of the Night\" about that guy who could\\'ve saved that other guy from drownin\\'. But didn\\'t, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?. That\\'s kinda how this is. You could\\'ve rescued me from drowning. Now it\\'s too late, I\\'m on a thousand downers now, I\\'m drowsy. And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall. I loved you, Slim, we could\\'ve been together ? think about it!. You ruined it now, I hope you can\\'t sleep. And you dream about it. And when you dream. I hope you can\\'t sleep and you scream about it. I hope your conscience eats at you. And you can\\'t breathe without me. See, Slim--shut up, bitch! I\\'m tryin\\' to talk. Hey, Slim, that\\'s my girlfriend screamin\\' in the trunk. But I didn\\'t slit her throat, I just tied her up, see, I ain\\'t like you. ?Cause if she suffocates she\\'ll suffer more. And then she\\'ll die too. Well, gotta go, I\\'m almost at the bridge now. Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?. [Hook: Dido]. My tea\\'s gone cold. I\\'m wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can\\'t see at all. And even if I could it\\'ll all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it\\'s not so bad, it\\'s not so bad. [Verse 4: Eminem]. Dear, Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy. You said your girlfriend\\'s pregnant now. How far along is she?. Look, I\\'m really flattered you would call your daughter that. And here\\'s an autograph for your brother. I wrote it on a . Starter cap. I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t see you at the show, I must\\'ve missed you. Don\\'t think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you. But what\\'s this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clowning, dawg. Come on, how fucked up is you?. You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin\\'. To help your ass from bouncin\\' off the walls. When you get down some. And what\\'s this shit about us meant to be together?. That type of shit\\'ll make me not want us to meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time. Before you hurt yourself, I think that you\\'ll be doing just fine. If you relax a little, I\\'m glad I inspire you. But Stan, why are you so mad?. Try to understand that I do want you as a fan. I just don\\'t want you to do some crazy shit; I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge. And had his girlfriend in the trunk. And she was pregnant with his kid. And in the car they found a tape. But they didn\\'t say who it was to. Come to think about it, his name was? it was you, damn. '},\n",

That\\'s when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped. Rather mine, I don\\'t know what made me leave that shit. Made me speed that quick, let me see ? that\\'s it.

You have given away without getting at me. That\\'s your fault, how many times you forgiven me?. How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?. I know the way a nigga living was whack. But you don\\'t get a nigga back like that!. Shit, I\\'m a man with pride, you don\\'t do shit like that. You don\\'t just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that. You don\\'t throw away what we had, just like that. I was just fucking them girls, I was gon\\' get right back. I\\'ll mourn forever, shit. I\\'ve got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever.

Time to take a stand and save our future. Like we all got shot, we all got shot. Throwing up our hands don\\'t let them shoot us. Cause we all we got, we all we got. God ain\\'t put us on the Earth to get murdered, it\\'s murder. God ain\\'t put us on the Earth to get murdered, it\\'s murder. Don\\'t point your weapons at me. [Verse 1: Game]. Seen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son. Tired of them killing us, I\\'m on my way to Ferguson. Talked to TIP, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me. Mothers crying \"Stop the riots\", we ain\\'t got to chalk the city. I seen Cole out there, felt I should go out there. They left that boy for hours in the cold out there. They killin\\' teens, they killin\\' dreams (It\\'s murder). Yo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got. Police taking shots and I ain\\'t talkin\\' bout Ciroc. I\\'m talking bout Emmett Till. I\\'m talking bout Ezell Ford. I\\'m talking bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for. Trayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos. History keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental. America\\'s a glass house and my revenge is mental. Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window. [Verse 3: Rick Ross]. I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold. Hands in the sky, still was left in the road. Ribbon in the sky, Michael Brown, another soul. Stole by the system, black men we pay the toll. The price is your life, Uncle Sam want a slice. Black dress code now we looting in the night. Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust. And I know they hate to hear me screaming, \\'I\\'m a Boss!\\'. Time to take a stand and save our future. Like we all got shot, we all got shot. Throwing up our hands don\\'t let them shoot us. Cause we all we got, we all we got. God ain\\'t put us on the Earth to get murdered, it\\'s murder. God ain\\'t put us on the Earth to get murdered, it\\'s murder. Don\\'t point your weapons at me. [Verse 4: 2 Chainz]. Tired of the okie-dokie, lying you Pinocchio. Driving while black, tell me, where am I supposed to go?. Gun shots hit the car, now I got the holy ghost. If excessive force was a drug, then they overdosed. Got us tryna protest, it\\'s a slow process. Heard it\\'s a lotta rotten eggs in the crow\\'s nest. People praying on they feet, police holding on they heat. Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street. Yeah, I seen a lot of ice water tossed and I know it\\'s for a cause. My only question is, what we doing for the loss. Of Mike Brown?. Cause right now, I challenge you to use your talents to. Speak up, and don\\'t you ever let em silence you. Cause action speaks louder than words, that\\'s what I heard. Shot down with his hands up, that\\'s what occurred. Man that sound absurd. Matter fact to me that sound like murder. We want justice. Ay yo Game, I had a crib out there. I used to live out there. So I know how niggas feel out there. People stressing, protesting, unity is a blessing. So it\\'s time we come together. Use our voice as a weapon. I am Michael Brown, cause I stand for what he stand for. News say we\\'re looting. Paint pictures like we some animals. On my NWA CMG. Holl\\'in\\' \"Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police\". Heard another brother slain up in St. Louis. Sure the mother feel the pain, but what you famous doing. I?m sure the general population trying to be more active. But when the light finally catches you, you\\'re ice challenged. Okay, and I support the ALS just like the rest of them. But you have yet to pay your debt. So you just flexing then. Cause everybody care for a minute, then stop. People only there for a minute, then stop. And what\\'s the point of giving if you ain\\'t giving your all. We never getting ahead, might as well give up your heart. Where does it end?. I got my hands up, what else am I supposed to do?. (Rest in peace to Mike Brown). Where does it end?. (And all the other fallen soldiers). Tell me, where\\'s the love for everything we\\'re going through?. (That will not be on the news or televised, ah). Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me. Hope that God can save us. Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me. (As we lead in peace). Martin Luther King had a dream. But they ain\\'t respecting Jesse up out here. And they don\\'t really respect Obama out here. Lights out, go dark - it\\'s like a nightmare. How the fuck you play the game, but they ain\\'t playing fair. It\\'s going down, Armageddon right here. Right now, not on TV but right here. Put your flags in the air if you don\\'t really care (wave it). We need justice yeah, we need justice here. I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him. Television broadcasts, a confused country. I\\'m a resident of a nation that don\\'t want me. What\\'s done is done. the town erupts in fury. And I\\'m already hearing bout this lopsided jury. Three faces like his, the rest another story. A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried. [Verse 10: Problem]. The revolution has been televised. If I sit here and do don\\'t do nothing, homie, that\\'s genocide. Fuck that, we have arrived. And who cares who ain\\'t on our side cause we on our own. How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?. My brodie Game just banged my line like \"We gotta do something\". All that marching and that peace ain\\'t gonna fucking do nothing. Fuck it, my moms, sorry I\\'m ready to rage. The police done let the animals out of the cage. [Hook: Game\\'s daughter]. Time to take a stand and save our future. Like we all got shot, we all got shot. Throwing up our hands don\\'t let them shoot us. Cause we all we got, we all we got. God ain\\'t put us on the Earth to get murdered, it\\'s murder. God ain\\'t put us on the Earth to get murdered, it\\'s murder. Don\\'t point your weapons at me. Stand up. '},\n",

Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits. Picture a high school drop out. Rollin' a double R. House full of happiness, weed and drank. Way out. Never visioned living longer than my twenty first. Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt. And though it hurts to see the change. It comes with the fame. Watch them gossip in this silly game. To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night. Why's everybody caught up in Pac's life?. To all y'all niggas, conversating on my life. Mind your motherfucking business. I remember that. Ay. What's happening Pac. Yeah I know we never got to meet. But we know all the same people so we got to speak. You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G. And all the shit you went through. Meant a lot to me. But when they locked you up for nothing it was shame to see. You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me. I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be. Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me. And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see. Now they all in the court room blaming me. See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle. Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's. Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em. Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's. Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's. With the same sort of dude with the same short fuse. [Verse 3: 2Pac]. I want money in large amounts. My garage full of cars that bounce. Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts. They jump my automatic keep 'em weary. While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass. Nigga you scary, I been knowing you for years. We was high school peers, in Junior High. I was itching' to kill, and you was, 'Ready To Die'. While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases. Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places. Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried. Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried. Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'mma ride. Pick my enemies out the crowd. and motherfucker's die. It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga it's how it is. Only real niggas stay on top.

I know I\\'m guilty of it too but, not like them. You lost one. Lose one, let go to get one. Get one, lose some to win some (You lost one). Story of a champion, sorry I\\'m a champion. You lost one. [Verse 2]. I don\\'t think it\\'s meant to. be, be. But she loves her work more than she does me. And honestly, at twenty-three. I would probably love my work more than I did she. So, we, ain\\'t we. It\\'s me, and her. Cause what she prefers over me, is work. And that\\'s, where we, differ. So I have to give her. Free, time, even if it hurts. So breathe, mami, it\\'s deserved. You\\'ve been put on this earth to be. All you can be, like the reserves. And me? My time in the army, it\\'s served. So I have to allow she, her, time to serve. The time\\'s now for her. In time she\\'ll mature. And maybe we, can be, we, again like we were. Finally, my time\\'s too short to share. And to ask her now, it ain\\'t fair. So yeah, she lost one. [Verse 3]. My nephew died in the car I bought. So I\\'m under the belief it\\'s partly my fault. Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought. Place any burden on me, but please, not that lord. But time don\\'t go back, it goes forward. Can\\'t run from the pain, go towards it. Some things can\\'t be explained, what caused it?. Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!. Gonna see you again, I\\'m sure of it. \\'Til that time, little man I\\'m nauseous. Your girlfriend\\'s pregnant, the lord\\'s gift. Almost lost my faith, that restored it. It\\'s like having your life restarted. Can\\'t wait for your child\\'s life, to be a part of it. So now I\\'m child-like, waiting for a gift. To return, when I lost you, I lost it. Lose one, let go to get one. Get one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one). Story of a champion, Colleek, you\\'re a champion. I lost one. '},\n",

Forever hottie hunting,.  trigger temper I\\'m quick to body something. You looking at me like I\\'m probably fronting. I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest. I\\'m older and smarter this is me at my best. I stopped hanging around y\\'all cause niggas like you. Be praying on my downfall, hoping I flop. Hoping I stop, you probably even hope I get locked. Or be on the street corner with a pipe smoking the rock. I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you. Only thing I haven\\'t got is more stitches than you. Fucking punk, you ain\\'t a leader what, nobody followed you. You was never shit, your mother should have swallowed you. You on some tag-along flunky yes man shit. Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick. And if you think I can\\'t fuck with whoever, put your money up. Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up.

And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nothing Butthead. My game is vicious and cruel Fucking chicks is a rule. If my girl think I\\'m loyal then that bitch is a fool. How come you can listen to my first album. And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from?. So what you acting for?. You ain\\'t half as raw, you need to practice more.

I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back. Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that. Yo, I?m not in the mood son, so don?t push me tonight. Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right. That pussy was tight ? gripping my dick like a pair of pliers. You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires. It?s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh. I?ma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass. Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin\\'. My album is done, so no there ain\\'t no parts open. I?m not a sweet stud, I?m a street thug. That?s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood. You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off. Then call all off, and tear your jaw off. My life is far out, I got star clout. Every week bring a different car out. Go to clubs and buy the bar out. You ain?t a player, put that cigar out. Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off. Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph. I rocked many stages and never got booed off. I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse. For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first. Cause none of y\\'all niggas can fuck with me. And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me. We puff much izzy. I do shit that only tough men do. And them cats you with fuck them too, I?ll buck them too. Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga. No dough, always on the train-ass nigga. Canal street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga. You got fucked upstate, you cupcake. How many dicks can your butt take. I ran through every bitch in my path. I was fuckin\\' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half.

And your speech gets slow and hazy. Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you. Know that history holds more than it seems. We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream. From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships. And stood half naked on auction blocks. From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants. And were mis-named on Ellis island.

Instead, it hits the pockets of the Preacher just to purchase. A house, with a swimming pool, labels me a sinning fool. I'm just a nigga who inherited a winning jewel.

For all the fame, and flashing lights. Do you think I sacrifice, a real life. For all the fame, and flashing lights. There is no Gucci I can buy. There is no Louis Vuitton to put on. There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell. To get my heart, out of this hell. And my mind, out of this jail. There is no clothes that I could buy. That could turn, back in time. There is no vacation spot I could fly. That could bring back, a piece of real life. Real life, what does it feel like?. I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight. What does it feel like, I ask you tonight. To live a real life. I just wanna be a real boy. They always say \"Kanye, he keeps it real boy\". Pinocchio\\'s story is, I just wanna be a real boy. Pinocchio\\'s story goes, to be a real boy. It\\'s funny. Pinocchio, lied, and that\\'s what kept him from it. I tell the truth, and I keep running. It\\'s like I\\'m lookin for something out there, tryna find something. I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing. What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real. Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel. Do you really have the stamina?. For everybody that sees you that say, \"Where\\'s my camera?\". For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph. For everybody that sees you cryin, say you oughta laugh. You oughta laugh!?. I just wanna be a real boy. Pinocchio\\'s story goes, I just wanna be a real boy. Pinocchio\\'s story goes. And there is no Gepetto, to guide me. No one, right beside me. The only one, was behind me. I can\\'t find her no more, I can\\'t follow no more. I can\\'t... The only one that come out on the tour and stays. Back when I was livin at home and this was all a big dream. And the fame will be get got. And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault. All my fault to be a real boy, chasin the American dream. Chasin everything we seen, up on the TV screen. And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left. And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death. Thinkin\\' the money that the-. You spend the dough to death. And tell me what be left, for a real boy!. They say \"Kanye, you keep it too real boy\". Perspective, and wise man say. One day, you\\'ll find your way. The wise man say, you\\'ll find your way.

Where fake niggas don\\'t make it back. I don\\'t know how to start this shit, yo... now. [Verse 1]. Rappers, I monkey flip \\'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin\\'. Musician, inflictin\\' composition of pain. I\\'m like Scarface sniffin\\' cocaine. Holding an M16, see with the pen I\\'m extreme, . now. Bullet holes left in my peepholes. I\\'m suited up in street clothes, . hand me a 9 and I\\'ll defeat foes. Y\\'all know my steelo with or without the airplay. I keep some E&J, sitting bent up in the stairway. Or either on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs. Laughing at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps. G-packs get off quick, . forever niggas talk shit. Reminiscing about the last time the task force flipped. Niggas be running through the block shootin\\'. Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston. Once they caught us off-guard. The MAC-10 was in the grass and. I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin. Picked the MAC up, told brothers, \"Back up!\" the MAC spit. Lead was hittin\\' niggas, one ran ? I made him backflip. Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn\\'t look. Gave another squeeze, heard it click, \"Yo, my shit is stuck\". Try to cock it, it wouldn\\'t shoot, now I\\'m in danger. Finally pulled it back. And saw three bullets caught up in the chamber. So now I\\'m jetting to the building lobby, and it was full of children probably, couldn\\'t see as high as I be. (So what you sayin\\'?) . It\\'s like the game ain\\'t the same. Got younger niggas pulling the triggers. Bringing fame to their name. And claim some corners, . crews without guns are goners. In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us. 45\\'s and gauges, MAC\\'s, in fact. Same niggas will catch you back-to-back. Snatching your cracks in black. There was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked. So hold your stash \\'til the coke price drop. I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock. And if it\\'s good, she\\'ll bring you customers in measuring pots. But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation, inside information. Keeps large niggas erasin\\' and their wives basin\\'. It drops deep as it does in my breath. I never sleep, ?cause sleep is the cousin of death. Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined. I think of crime when I\\'m in a New York state of mind. New York state of mind. Be having dreams that I\\'m a gangsta. Drinking Moets, . holding TEC\\'s. Making sure the cash came correct, then I stepped. Investments in stocks, . sewing up the blocks to sell rocks. Winning gunfights with mega-cops. But just a nigga walking with his finger on the trigger. Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger. I ain\\'t the type of brother made for you to start testin\\'. Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin\\'. Thinking of cash flow, buddha and shelter. Whenever frustrated, I\\'m a hijack Delta. In the PJ\\'s, my blend tape plays, . bullets are strays. Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze. Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed. From what I hear in all the stories. When my peoples come back, . black. I\\'m living where the nights is jet-black. The fiends fight to get crack. I just max, I dream I can sit back. And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn. Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes. I got so many rhymes, I don\\'t think I\\'m too sane. Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain. And be prosperous, though we live dangerous. Cops could just arrest me, blaming us. We\\'re held like hostages. It\\'s only right that I was born to use mics. And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes. I\\'ve taken rappers to a new plateau, . through rap slow. My rhymin\\' is a vitamin held without a capsule. The smooth criminal on beat breaks. Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes. The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps. That\\'s where I learned to do my hustle. Had to scuffle with freaks. I\\'m an addict for sneakers. 20\\'s of buddha and bitches with beepers. In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya. Inhale deep like the words of my breath. I never sleep, ?cause sleep is the cousin of death. I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times. Nothing\\'s equivalent to the New York state of mind.

No religion or race could ever describe us. My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it. Forever begins just because I thought about it. I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come. Forever gon' come. It's a cold world and I can never go numb. Look fear in the eyes, say I never gon' run. Sooner then later, I know the cheddar gon' come. For now I write the world letters to better the young. On tree by jury, together we hung. Now we let our chains hang. and gang bang to maintain. No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor. It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone. That's when I knew we'd live forever through song. Well, well well. Here we are back in the studio again. Look at that. Hey I don' need no cue cards. They got the engineers holdin up the cue cards. What that say?. Oh they say, just talk, don't sing. Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here forever. Every peak will have 2 valleys. War, war, and more war. Columbine. Virginia Tech,. The pot of humanity; sift the ingredients.

And for what your life\\'s worth, this money is twice than. Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland. See I\\'m a nice man but money turned me to Satan.

I want the whole pie, I won\\'t be denied Nathan. Maybe I need my head inside straightened, brain contemplating. Clean out the register, dip before somebody catches ya. Or gets your description and sketches ya. Then connects you as the prime suspect. But I ain\\'t set to flee the scene of the crime just yet. Cause I got a daughter to feed. And two hundred dollars ain\\'t enough to water the seed. The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell. And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring.

Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face:. \"Shut your yacking mouth. \\'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!\". Drug her by her hair, smacked her up. Thinking fuck it, mug her while you\\'re there, jacked her up. Stole her car and made a profit,. grabbed the tape from out the deck. And lost it out the window like the girl in Set It Off did. Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I\\'m a criminal. Drove it through somebody\\'s yard, dove into they swimming pool. Climbed out and collapsed on the patio. I made it out alive but I\\'m injured badly though. Parents screaming, \"Johnny go in and call the police. Tell em there\\'s a crazy man disturbing all of the peace\". Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up. Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff. Acting like they never seen nobody. hit a lick before. Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64. When they sell out in stores the price triples. I ran up the block jumping kids on tricycles. And collided with an 80-year-old lady with groceries. There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties. Stood up and started to see stars. Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars. Barely escaped, must\\'a been some dumb luck. Jumped up and climbed the back of a moving dump truck. But I think somebody seen me maybe. Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must\\'a dropped a Beanie Baby. Fuck it I give up, I\\'m surrounded in blue suits. Came out with a white flag hollering \"truce-truce\". And surrendered my weapon to cops. Wasn\\'t me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps. All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate. Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate.

The Penitentiary\\'s packed, and it\\'s filled with blacks. I wake up in the mornin\\' and I ask myself. Is life worth livin\\'? Should I blast myself?. I\\'m tired of being poor and, even worse, I\\'m black. My stomach hurts, so I\\'m lookin\\' for a purse to snatch. Cops give a damn about a negro. Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he\\'s a hero. Mo\\' nigga, mo\\' nigga, mo\\' niggas. Rather I\\'d be dead than a po\\' nigga. Let the Lord judge the criminals. If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto. [Hook & (Ad-Lib)]. I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto. I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto. And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto. I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto. I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto.

See she had game, she needed me to coach her. Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture. The way a righteous pimp is supposed to. As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune. I ain't having it like abortion. Walking with this stick holding his tip. Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp. It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride. Act like I didn't see him I tried. Motion denied. I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers. She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators. Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure. That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand. I'm a take you to a pimps promise land. Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya. Make your next move your best move, choose me. How I look working for a nigga in a kufi. If I was on a track you couldn't produce me. With them shits on your wrist looking goofy. I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel. You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level. Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream. Nigga you must not know of me. I'm the mack here. Ought to have you ho for me. Pimp yo punk ass. Have you write me poetry. I'm from a lane called cash. You too slow for me. Birds in slick cars. Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars. If you become mine the world would be ours. Respect the game, and universal laws. What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall. Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball. I know pimpin ain't easy. damn you barely surviving. We can't ride together cause you ain't driving. You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson. I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track. Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract. Got stores called big pimpin (Common: Where). Down South. In Texas I ran the best ho house. Choushi wa dou. (HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha). (Common: Why you laughin). I'm laughin cause you funny. I'm make bitch niggas like you have my money. I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly. You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki. Yo, what ever happened to loyalty. Don't you want to become royalty. On the streets selling ass and oils for me. But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you. Fuckyou then I'm about to be a preacher. \"},\n",

Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler. I show you the ropes, connect the dots. . A country girl that love Hollywood. Mama used to cook red beans and rice. Now it\\'s Denny\\'s, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite. Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection. Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians.

Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap\\'n Crunch cereal. Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me. Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday. Bottle service, head service, I came in first place. The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek. The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee. And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets. Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity. And yeah G, I was all for it. She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet.

Please, baby, no more parties in L.A. Friday night tryna make it into the city. Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty. Thinking back to how I got here in the first place. Second class bitches wouldn\\'t let me on first base. A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds. And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs. Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous. When did I become A list? I wasn\\'t even on a list. Strippers get invited to where they only get hired. When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon\\' get fired. I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired. And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir. Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary. I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries. For all my niggas with babies by bitches. That use they kids as meal tickets. Not knowing the disconnect from the father. The next generation will be the real victims. I can\\'t fault \\'em really. I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain\\'t going back to Philly. Back to our regularly scheduled programmin\\'. Of weak content and slow jammin\\'. But don\\'t worry, this one\\'s so jammin\\'. You know it, L.A., it\\'s so jammin\\'. I be thinkin\\' every day. Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades. I be paranoid every time.

A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems. Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don\\'t never drive it. It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out. And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out. God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam. Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam. Thank God for me. Whole family gettin\\' money, thank God for E!. I love rockin\\' jewelry, a whole neck full. Bitches say he funny and disrespectful. I feel like Pablo when I\\'m workin\\' on my shoes. I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news. I feel like Pablo when I\\'m workin\\' on my house. Tell \\'em party\\'s in here, we don\\'t need to go out.

My pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity. They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family. The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried. I got a line on the D.A. ?cause I'm fuckin' his secretary. I black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all. They panic, and bitches duckin', I rush 'em and fuck 'em all. I'll probably be an old man before I understand. Why I have to live my life with pistols close at hand. Kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad. They even raped her, so we blazed they pad. Automatic shots rang out, on every block. They puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops. I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams. And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin'. What is the meanin' when thugs cry?. Oh, why should you send your child off to die?. In the streets of chalk where they lie. Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, . dear God (when thugs cry). Oh my, does it have to be this way?. Our children of today won't stay wise. Let the children hear when thugs cry, . dear God, oh why?. Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'. Where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug. Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary. Niggas I used to love, enclosed in Penitentiaries. But still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel. To lose your life, over something that you did as a kid?. You all alone, no communication, block on the phone. Don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone. Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song. To help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone. We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches. We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches. But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange. Lost all my homies over cocaine, mayne. See, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie. See, you gotta get high or die, . ?cause even thugs cry. Oh, why should you send your child off to die?. In the streets of chalk where they lie. Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, . dear God. Oh my, does it have to be this way?. Our children of today won't stay wise. Let the children hear when thugs cry, . dear God, oh why?. And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures. Bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures. ?Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don. I write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone. Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?. So merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams. Leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood. Clownin', takin' pictures later. Laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches. Regulate my area, the terror I represent. Makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went. Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?. Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told. Come take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer!. Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long. Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?. I suppose that's why I murder my foes; when thugs cry. Oh, why should you send your child off to die?. In the streets of chalk where they lie. Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, . dear God. Oh my, does it have to be this way?. Our children of today won't stay wise. Let the children hear when thugs cry, . dear God, oh why?. Oh, why should you send your child off to die?. In the streets of chalk where they lie. Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, . dear God. Oh my, does it have to be this way?. Our children of today won't stay wise. Let the children hear when thugs cry, . dear God, oh why?. I shed tattooed tears for years. For my dead homeboys and my prison peers. \"},\n",

Every place and event ? been there, done that. Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went. Want a deal? Study these five chapters. Lesson 1: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers. Lesson 2: Face \\'em and diss \\'em. Don\\'t give em a demo; kidnap \\'em. And make \\'em come to your basement and listen. Lesson 3: Get a job at a label. Switch demos with Canibus.

You know I just be saying that to get you mad. What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play. Ain\\'t no need to sit inside the house and hibernate. Hi, Ren?e! I was just about to toss a live grenade. In your driveway and drive away. Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?. Blood drippin\\' from it. Rippin\\' your stomach like a paper m?ch?. You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill though. I\\'m sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow. Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh. Jumped up, choked a giraffe. Snapped his neck and broke it in half. Waging wars, went on stage. And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange. And wiped my ass with his page in Source. The demon is here, steamin\\' this year. I rip [Mystikal\\'s] voice box out and scream in his ear. It\\'s not a gimmick, bitch; it\\'s an image, I live it. Give a fuck?

I\\'ll fucking? lay your nuts on the dresser. Just your nutsack by itself. And bang them shits with a spiked bat. Cut your neck off and sew your head right back. And leave you like that. You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor. Who\\'s itching to leave you disfigured. And stiffer than Chris-stiff-er Reeves. I was teething with strep throat. While your mother was breastfeeding. And gave her the flesh-eating disease. I\\'m iller than taking a hammer and beating your knees. And walking through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans. (Am I a Blood or a Crip?). Waking up the next day in breathing machines. Flashing back to being shot and repeating the scenes. On how you just got smoked. And if you do live. You\\'ll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and Pac joke. '},\n",

It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper.. That\\'s something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space.. Everybody knows that they\\'re going to die. But after you\\'re in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.. 2Pac\\'s aggressive records are my favorite. \"Hail Mary\" is just perfect:. \"Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted.\" Most artists now just aren\\'t smart enough to write that,. or honest enough to write a line like, \"I ain\\'t a killer but don\\'t push me.\". These days rappers will just tell you, \"I\\'ll kill you.\". 2Pac was like a camera. It\\'s incredible how much he wrote ? how much he documented.. To me, \\'Pac was more of a poet than a rapper. You can always tell when you\\'re hearing 2Pac verse.. He wrote those lyrics without any music.. Notorious B.I.G. was more melody-driven ? I\\'m sure he wrote his shit without a pen, and over the music ? but \\'Pac was just hashing out his life. The thing was, he was doing that when the public eye was on him, and everything he was hashing out just expanded, and that\\'s when things got out of control.. All of us on the East Coast loved 2Pac.. The music was all that mattered. That East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef.. Now that he\\'s not here, he\\'s bigger than ever.. I can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight.. Sometimes I put on 2Pac\\'s best songs, followed by Biggie\\'s best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.. Laurence Fishburne. He told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. He said he didn\\'t like the way 2Pac behaved because he knew that 2Pac knew better.. I understood what he meant.

From weed habits are same now. No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes. And beats that be pumping. Before he left he taught me something. A child's young years the most important time to be there. That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here. I'm older now see what having a father's about. One day they can be in your life, next day they be out. It's not because of you, you know the deal. Him and your moms feel. If they stay together then someone will get killed. I love you still, always will. Cause that's my nigga.

Now me and Quik finna show you niggas what it's like on this side - the real side. Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers. And there's gonna be some pussies.

See, you got some niggas on your side that say they're your friends, but in real life they your enemies. See, the enemies will say they true. But in real life those niggas will be the snitches. 9-1-1! It's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me. From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me. Shit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed. Nothing more I despise than a liar. Cowards die. Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli. rumors. Switching up on you ordinary bitches. Like a southpaw you get left. Eternally I live in sin. [Chorus]. My guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse. Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll. In fly mode. I'm a homicidal outlaw. And 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on. Tonight's gonna be a fucking fight. So we might roll. But I'm a G to this til the day I'm gone, that's regardless. Ride by, niggas bow down. Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now. Convinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man. I died and came back. I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack. Scar'd up, but still flowing. Energized and still going. Uhh, can it be fate. That makes a sick motherfucker break. On these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake. What will it take?. Give me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb. Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed. The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again. Cause I've been sent. \"},\n",

The venom is contagious, be wary of its spell. What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell. I wonder if she knows, the devil's taking off her clothes. Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control. Poppa's doing worse, a victim of his deadly curse. Wouldn't be the first, to leave the ghetto in a hearse. Oh and how it hurts, the children pay the biggest price. Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life. Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap. Someone from the top, supplying us with plenty crack. Keep 'em in a daze, don't let them see the other way. Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day. See, they never got a breath of the sunshine. Now the kid's addicted and only hit it one time. We're destined to be dead as a nation. Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation. From pyramid top to bottom of bowl. From whips and locks to fist and afro. We dug too deep to give up this gold. Don't be bought, and you won't be sold. [Verse 2: 2Pac]. Gamble for your soul with the devil. You wonder how low, can you go, before you finally reach the lowest level. As everybody sit and stares. There's no use looking in your eyes cause there isn't anybody there. And though it may make you wanna cry. Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why. I guess you think they'll understand. You feel cold, cause you sold your soul to the dopeman. Oh now there's no turning back, in fact. I's decided, that would live and die for the crack. You got no friends cause you cheated 'em all. Feel lonely, low, defeated and small. No one was there when I took the wrong path. And nobody'd care if I died in a blood bath. But is this my destiny?. Tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me. Cause I'm ready to end it all. One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all. I didn't mean to be a bother. A failure as a son, a husband and a father. I wish I could turn back the time. Go back and find, why I let it crack my mind. And my only explanation, it came to this. Resist the temptation. From pyramid top to bottom of bowl. From whips and locks to fist and afro. We dug too deep to give up this gold. Don't be bought, and you won't be sold. [Verse 3: 2Pac]. Your death left family behind. Your wife and your son find a gun, and pieces of daddy's mind. On the door and on the floor. Now her husband is dead, what else is she living for?. So now she picks up the gun. Now son is the only one. Grows up in adoption homes. Gets older, bolder, and cold cause he's left alone. To him, nothing is funny. Mind set on one thing, making his money. Since I was left with no hope. I want money and gold ropes and so I slang dope. Now I'm the neighborhood dopeman. And as long cause they smoking I'll never be broke man. I live the life of a trifle. Following a cycle, so I'm just a psycho. But if I had a better life. I would have lived a good life and did more things right. Hard to resist temptation. With all the aggravation and the frustration. Of living in the ghetto. Your mind gets twisted, just like a pretzel. So it's time that I check out. But one nosy cop, just won't let me get out. They got me trapped once again. With a choice: shoot the cop, or live life in the pen. I can't stand the frustration. Resist the temptation. From pyramid top to bottom of bowl. From whips and locks to fist and afro. We dug too deep to give up this gold. Don't be bought, and you won't be sold. This song go out to the Underground Railround... \"},\n",

So I ain't pressed to make a CD, I took it slow. 80% of these niggas with deals. Can't see me with the dough, uh. More ice than winter '94. I toured the 50 states with a trunk of raw.

Was it, too good to be true?. Have nothin\\', get it all but too much of it. Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens. Cause if not, where the hell did it go?. Cause here I sit in Lucifer?s den by the dutch oven. Just choosing to sin. Even if it means I\\'m sellin\\' my soul, just to be the undisputed again. Do whatever I gotta do just to win. Cause I got this motherfuckin\\' cloud over my head. Crown around it, thorns on it. Cracks in it, bet you morons didn\\'t think I\\'d be back, did ya?. How \\'bout that, I?m somehow now back to the underdog. But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin\\' I never bow-out at. I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it\\'s a love-hate. But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt. Even when you bitches are countin\\' me out, and I appear to be down for the count. Only time I ever been out and about. Is drivin\\' around town with my fuckin\\' whereabouts in a doubt. Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here. but I\\'m not a quitter. Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up. Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin\\'. I\\'m tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong. Cause you\\'re moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?. Cause someone told me that. [Chorus: Gwen Stefani]. Kings never die. Don\\'t give me that sob story liar, don\\'t preach to the choir. You ain\\'t never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep. Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer. Wouldn\\'t even take shit into consideration. Obliterate anyone in the way. I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me. But it\\'d actually have to be a fuckin\\' blow-out to get me to re-tire. Tell these new artists that kings never die. I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page. Did it just say I\\'ve been upstaged?. Why am I online? It\\'s driving me crazy. I\\'m ridin\\' shotgun tryna get a gauge. On what\\'s hot, but I\\'m not one to conform. But as days pass in this shit. And opinions sway, I can hear \\'em say. If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous. Comeback as if I went away. But detractors just say so much for the Renegade. Someone\\'s gonna make me blow my composure. Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I\\'m in a cage. They so want a champion to fall. It\\'s no wonder why I laugh at \\'em, cause why can\\'t we win \\'em all?. So fuck what these cynics say. (It) just goes ta show that when my back\\'s against the wall. And I\\'m under a tack again, that I\\'ll act as if I\\'m \\'posed ta. With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office. On the floor stacked against the door. Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin\\' back again?. Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards. And trophies just don\\'t mean jack anymore. If I\\'m here today and gone tomorrow. And I\\'m not gonna be. [Chorus: Gwen Stefani]. Here to stay. Even when I\\'m gone. When I close my eyes. Through the passage of time. Kings never die. I want it, I\\'m comin\\' to get it. So you son of a bitches don\\'t duck you?re gonna get Riddick Bowe?d. Critics\\'ll end up in critical,. think your shit is dope all you\\'re gonna get is smoked. And I ain\\'t stopping \\'til I\\'m on top again, all alone and on a throne. Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I\\'ve been owed. Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone. And when it\\'s my time to go, I\\'m still not leaving. Stop for no one, I don\\'t know but I\\'ve been told an obstacle that. Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, cause. They say kings never die. Just ask Jam Master Jay. They just grow wings and they fly. So, hands up, reach for the sky. Try to hold on and prolong these moments. Cause in a blink of an eye. They\\'ll be over. Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur. And ensure nobody\\'s ever gonna be what you were. So before you\\'re leavin\\' this Earth. You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk. Deacon of words, syllable genius at work. Plus I\\'m thinkin\\' that they\\'re mistakin\\' my kindness for weakness, kill \\'em with meanness. I went from powdered milk and Farina. To flippin\\' burgers on the grill for some peanuts. At Gilbert\\'s to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers. I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky\\'s still what the theme is. Khalil on the beat cause makin\\' the beat ain?t the same feelin\\' to me as killin\\' the beat is. Or fulfillin\\' to me is what fillin\\' a seat is. It\\'s that \"Sound Bombing\" Thirstin\\' Howl. Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz. Stomach growl, throbbin\\' hunger, out-rhymin\\' everyone. God just give me one shot, I swear that I won\\'t let you down. I\\'mma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground. You ain\\'t never ever gonna hear \\'em say I ain\\'t. [Chorus: Gwen Stefani].

Had to re-up, see what\\'s up with my peeps. Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps. See who got smoked, what rumors was spread. Last I heard I was dead with six to the head. Then I got the phone call, it couldn\\'t hit me harder. We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter. Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of. By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners. And my bitch, swear to God she won\\'t snitch. I told her when she hit the bricks, I\\'ll make the hooker rich. Conspiracy, she\\'ll be home in three. Until then I looks out for the whole family; a true G, that\\'s me. Blowing like a bubble in the everyday struggle. I don\\'t wanna live no more. Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door. I\\'m living every day like a hustle. Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle. I don\\'t wanna live no more. Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door. I\\'m living every day like a hustle. Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle. I\\'m seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani. Ain\\'t tryin\\' to see no black man turn to John Gotti. My daughter use a potty so she\\'s older now. Educated street knowledge, I\\'mma mould her now. Dealing with the dope fiend binges, . seeing syringes. In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain. The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange. Breaking days on the set, no sweat. Drunk off Moet, can\\'t bag yet because it\\'s still wet. But when that dry, bagging five at a time. I can clock about nine on the check cashing line. I had the first and the third, rehearse, that\\'s my word. Thick in the game, D\\'s knew my first name. a TEC with air holes. And that\\'s just how the shit go in the struggle, mothafucka. Hah, come on, what you say?. I don\\'t wanna live no more. Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door. I\\'m living every day like a hustle. Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle. I don\\'t wanna live no more. Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door. I\\'m living every day like a hustle. Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle. I don\\'t wanna live no more. Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door. I\\'m living every day like a hustle. Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle. I don\\'t wanna live no more. Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door. I\\'m living every day like a hustle.

You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped. Swear to everything when I leave this earth. It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt. You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine. We'll lose two lives, yours and mines. Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve. At the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve. Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me. And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged. Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God. And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars. ..Lucky me. You only know what you see. You don't understand what it takes to be me. I hate all girls with ulterior motives. That's why I'm 20+ years old, no sons no daughters. Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters. Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own. Hate a nigga like that faggot, get your own. Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome. Knowing one day Im'a have to flip, c'mon. You know the shit don't stop 'til the Cris' don't pop. And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock. I'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact. It ain't no turning back.. Bring it on. Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much. Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?. Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us. Steady looking for flaws through us. Nigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly. But I know any type of success breeds envy. I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hem me. Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny. But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive. Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up. And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up. Don't grieve for me my art remains. Like a dart from the speaker to your heart. Spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal. Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life. Though I can't see past the girl's greed to call her wife. Next time you're thinking heist better be precise. Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here. I have no regrets even though I won't see grow. My godson Boogie, Sonny and Remo. \"},\n",

       "   'lyrics': 'This is the only thing I, thing I know. Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is. Find different ways to word the same old song. Ever since I came along. From the day the song called ?Hi! My Name Is? dropped. Started thinking my name was Fault. ?Cause any time things went wrong. I was the one who they would blame it on. The media made me the equivalent. Of a modern-day Genghis Khan. Tried to argue, it was only entertainment, dog. Gangster? Nah, courageous balls. Had to change my style, they said I\\'m way too soft. And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws. And the fangs been out since then. But up until the instant that I went against it, . it was ingrained in me that I wouldn\\'t amount to a shitstain, I thought. No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught. \"Do I really belong in this game?\", I pondered. I just wanna play my part; should I make waves or not?. So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on. And I don\\'t wanna seem ungrateful. Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon. But sometimes you gotta take a loss. And have people rub it in your face. Before you get made pissed off. And keep plugging, it\\'s your only outlet. And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it. Better find a way to counter it quick and make it? ah. Feel like I\\'ve already said this a kabillion eighty times. How many times can I say the same thing. Different ways that rhyme?. What I really wanna say is. If there\\'s anyone else that can relate to my story. Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to?. I was a... afraid to make a single sound. Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out. Afraid I\\'d never be found. I didn\\'t wanna go another round. An angry man\\'s power will shut you up. Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love. Run out of excuses for everyone. So here I am and I will not run. Guts over fear, the time is near. Guts over fear, I shed a tear. For all the times I let you push me \\'round. I let you keep me down. Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear. Feels like a close, it\\'s coming to. Fuck am I gonna do?. It\\'s too late to start over. This is the only thing I, thing I know. I know what it was like, I was there once. Single parents, hate your appearance. As you struggle to find your place in this world. And the pain spawns all the anger on. But it wasn\\'t \\'til I put the pain in song, learned who to aim it on. That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit. Learned how to harness it while the reins were off. And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part. Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck. Haters started to appreciate my art. And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused. But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone. And the lights go out in that trailer park. And the window is closing and there\\'s nowhere else that I can go with flows . and I\\'m frozen. ?Cause there\\'s no more emotion for me to pull from. Just a bunch of playful songs, that I make for fun. So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song. But I rather make ?Not Afraid 2?. Than make another motherfucking ?We Made You?, ah. Now, I don\\'t wanna seem indulgent. When I discuss my lows and my highs. My demise and my uprise, pray to God. I just open enough eyes later on. And gave you the supplies and the tools. To hopefully use that\\'ll make you strong. Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt. ?Cause I can\\'t explain to y\\'all how dang exhausted my legs felt. Just having to balance my dang self. When on eggshells, I was made to walk. But thank you, Ma, ?cause that gave me the. Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium least I made it out of that house. And found a place in this world when the day was done. So this is for every kid who all\\'s they ever did. Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted. I represent him or her, anyone similar. You are the reason that I made this song. And everything you\\'re scared to say. Don\\'t be afraid to say no more. From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk. Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off. The legend of the angry blonde. Lives on through you when I?m gone, . and to think I was a?. I was a? afraid to make a single sound. Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out. Afraid I\\'d never be found. I didn\\'t wanna go another round. An angry man\\'s power will shut you up. Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love. Run out of excuses for everyone. So here I am and I will not run. Guts over fear, the time is near. Guts over fear, I shed a tear. For all the times I let you push me \\'round. I let you keep me down. Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear. '},\n",

No engagement can amount to your friendship. And I hope that nigga know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream. DAMN!. I\\'ve been lonely, I\\'ve been waiting for you.

Promised never to cry. Held it all inside. Kept my mind fried. Slept for most of mine. Soon as I closed my eyes. Then I woke up behind. Thinkin' either I load up these nines. Or blow up with rhymes. Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca. And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme. Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms.

Niggas believe me it's ghetto libation, see it all before. Me, it's ghetto love, I bet you seen it all befo'. My people we get high, filling cigars with the lah. Nigga come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin' the throne. I said to rest in peace to Nina Simone. [Busta Rhymes]. Back in the days we was used to doin the shit. I can't call it all in the streets. We was hustlin fiends that asked for it. Newports and weed. If you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin. You had to go and study your lessons.

I know it's better in Heaven, ?cause being here ain't livin'. Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy. Still looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies. Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost. You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right. [Outro: 2Pac + (Keyshia Cole)]. Take your time, man (Take your time).

That\\'s when I go Bishop in Juice and start flexin\\' heat. You could get it in the stomach just like Raheem. Cause runnin\\' with a snitch is not quite my thing.

Hopefully you make it out in time to be on Detox. Cause Black Wall Street expandin\\', yeah I bought three blocks. My CL so smooth, it should\\'ve came with Pete Rock. And let\\'s not forget who made me hot. It was Dr. Dre that took me out the weed spot. You want credit, forget it, I did it on my own. Gave you 300 bars. then said I\\'m gone.

And Snoop is like my big brother, we both raised by the Doc. Young Jeezy you hot, we both new to this. While I\\'m in the ATL, shout out to Ludacris. Cause your uncle Scarface show me that crime pays. Just like Paul Wall got me sittin\\' sideways. And I can\\'t forget about the homie Mike Jones. Who? Mike Jones, Skeet screw the fuckin\\' song.

And every moment be controlling me. Jodeci. And when I come over and bend ya ass,. you be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass. I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow. Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last. No matter how much of a thug you see. I still spit it like it's R&B. And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin me.

Even her body language told the story. Her name was Mahogany - twin?s name was Ebony. Ra. Eric B. But once I entered your mind I wouldn?t wanna stop. Caress your thoughts til we was thinking the same. Calm your nerves, massage your brain. Each moment's a mineral, poetry?s protein. Verse is a vitamin. affects like codeine. So tell me how you feel and I?ll reveal. A pill that?ll heal ya pain, ?cause I?m real. She musta OD?d ?cause she couldn?t resist. She said she?d have my kids and help me make my next G. Tell me I ain?t finessed. Mahogany. So I prescribed her, something to revive. And surprise her. she?s liver and much more wiser. From the light I shine when my brain cells spark. Constantly so she can glow in the dark. And soon, you can represent the moon. I?ll tell you who you are and why you're here. Take it in stride ?cause it might take a year. It?s funny - how time flies when you're havin? fun. We got close and it was almost one. She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go. Fuck around and miss the show. So I told her to hold that thought real tight. We can finish where we left off later on tonight. Back to the scene of the crime on time. As they introduced the fiend of a rhyme. She stood in the crowd with a birds-eye view of me. Thinking of later on of what she would do to me. I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore. The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore. Wanted my agony agony ag-on-y in her bod-y. New York state of mind. she?ll entertain then sing some. Sentimental, songs real gentle. It hit the spot and you know where it went to. As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin?. I knew she was in the mood for somethin?. It wasn?t the Perignon that made her collapse. \"},\n",

And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did. I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big. She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions. Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions. Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked. She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks. Bankers and diplomats. She the scratch on my back. Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I dont know how to act. When she not around, Im heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat.

Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick. Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich. [Verse 2]. All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket. It's so much of you I share you. You got me karats on my wrist. I'm a savage for your kiss. Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard. Trump and Marla Maple. Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre. slingin' all night long, fiendin' to stroke ya. Seeing niggas wit' you I wasn't happy. Wanted to stick them up to get you,. heard you calling for daddy. And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife. Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right. Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow. My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note. [Verse 3]. I won't sell my soul to you. What do I owe to you. My cars, my house, my flow to you. Screw you. Before you. Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you. The envy me cause I'm wit you. You floss too much. Turn niggas out, one touch. For you, my guns bust. You always said in GOD we trust. It's hard enough to keep counting on you. You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you. I think I liked you better when you were illegal. But you had to get professional. Musical. Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic. Stick you in ATM's,. limited cash quick. Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it. Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets. Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me. I guess bitches like you just grow on trees. \"},\n",

Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven. We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors. Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors. Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue. Grants, Jacksons no room for George. Fear of God. This art imitate my life. You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype. Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice. My music for your soul, inspiration for your life. Every dime made in his life more disastrous. Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters. The truth hurts everytime it?s revealed. What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel. Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park. Kentucky derby on the grill. The fact that I?m free lets me know God is great. Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate. These rappers talk crowns but I?d rather talk fear. Villian like candyman, say my name and I?ll appear. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. Hakuna matata. feet up sipping java. Strolling up the totem poll, what?s my only problem. Scrolling through my Rolodex,. who shall bear my toddler. So many hands raised as the band plays. I?m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change. Penitentiary chances, the devil dances. And eventually answers to the call of Autumn. All of them fallin? for the love of ballin?. Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin. Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums. Based off the way we was branded. Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon. And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it?s random. But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage. I need a happy ending and a new beginning. And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative. And sold your dreams, you don?t know who did it. I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids. I won?t be satisfied til all my niggas get it. I need more drinks and more lights. Hot American Apparal girl in just tights. She told the director she tryna get in a school. Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool. It?s been a while since I watched the tube. Its like a crip said: ?I got way too many blues for any more bad news?. I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today. They rewrite history I don?t believe in yesterday. What?s a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach. I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach. But God said I need a different approach. Cause people is looking at me like I?m sniffing coke. It ain't funny anymore try different jokes. Tell ?em hug and kiss my ass, x and o. Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I?m got it. Play strings for the dramatic. And end all of that wack shh. Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes. I ain't got it I?m going after whoever who has it. I?m coming after whoever who has it. You blowing up, that?s good, fantastic. That y?all, its like that ya?ll. I don?t really give a fuck about it at all. Cause the same people that tried to black ball me. Forgot about 2 things, my black balls. [Pusha T]. Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me. The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy. I?m drawing from both sides, I?m Siamese. The tug of war opens the door,. entrada. Rip me apart and see what?s inside this pinata. One chapter of black magic, I?m Harold Potter. Feels like I?m doomed to dealing with women whom. Relationships with their fathers won?t allow us to bloom. And blossom,. I swear this Vegas nights was awesome. em. Some other muthafuckers double crossed ?em. Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune. the. we was like the four horsemen. Rick Flair with the flame, I?m muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo. As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih. Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss. Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head. The bright lights blind look what the devil did. Yeah. [Kanye West]. It?s hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion. The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing. This is more than just my road to redemption. Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention. As long as I?m in Polo?s they think they got me. But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me. I thought I chose a field where they couldn?t sack me. If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet. But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus. Ready for the Worl?s game, this is my Olympics. We make ?em say ho cause the game is so pimpish. Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick. And I assisted to get up offa this dick. And these drugs, fans can't resist it. Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted. If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!. \"},\n",

I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies. 'Til them niggas started slangin', now they don't know me. I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me. Lately I've been tryin' to make a mill-ion, can you blame me?. With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me. If them cowards really want me, come get me,. and even I. Someday will die but I'm cautious,. I'm fin' to ride. Put down the top, now we flossin'. Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window. Workin' with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good. Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs. And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, though it's bad. But all we had was our hopes and dreams. Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends. As Young Niggas. He's the kind of G like everybody knows. (As a strung nigga). He's always G'd up, from head to toe. (My memories as a young nigga). Always got it blown like Al Capone. He's the downest G I've ever known. Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died. That's when my momma started gettin' high. My neighborhood was full of drive-bys, couldn't survive. All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry. Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket. Let me get my dead homies high. Come follow me throughout my history, it's just. Me Against the World stuck in misery;. as a young nigga. My only thing was to be paid. Life full of riches avoid snitches cause they shady,. back in the days. We always found the time to play. But that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray.

Muh'fuckers need to just calm down. And peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life. 'Fore you end your life before you begin your life. You dumb nigga. Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein' somethin'. Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin. Tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real. And I will even if it kills me,. my Young Niggas. Break away from these dumb niggas. Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come figure. Fame is a fast thang,. that gangbangin'.

I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse. The epidemic and diseases, what is the future?. The projects lookin' hopeless, where. More and more brothers givin' up and don't care. Sometimes I hate when brothers act up,. I hit the weed. And I proceed to blow the track up, for Young Niggas. He's the kind of G like everybody knows. (for the young niggas).

This is for the masses, the lower classes. The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living. But we were kept out. Made to feel inferior, but we\\'re superior. Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya. Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us. Honour a man that that refuses to respect us. Emancipation Proclamation? Please!. Lincoln just said that to save the nation. These are lies that we all accepted. Say no to drugs but the governments\\' kept it. Running through our community, killing the unity. The war on drugs is a war on you and me. And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free. But if you ask me, it\\'s all about hypocrisy. The constitution, yo, it don\\'t apply to me. And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me. This made me strong, and no one\\'s gonna like what I\\'m pumpin\\'. But its wrong to keep someone from learning something. So get up, its time to start nation building.

AMERIK-K-KA. I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault. For suppressing and punishing my people. I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history. I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me. Trapped in the projects. And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts. And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes. Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence?. Words of Wisdom. Based upon the strength of a nation. Conquer the enemy armed with education. Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do. Know thyself, teach by what we\\'ve been through. Armed with the knowledge of the place we\\'ve been. No one will ever oppress this race again. No Malcolm X in my history text, why\\'s that?. ?Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks. Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?. He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek. I don\\'t get it, so many questions went through my mind. I get sweated. they act like asking questions is a crime. Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line. The American Dream, though it seems like it\\'s attainable. They\\'re pulling your sleeve, don\\'t believe. ?Cause it will strangle ya. Pulling the life of your brain, I can\\'t explain. Beg as you can obtain from which you came. Swear that your mother is living in equality. Forgetting your brother that\\'s living in poverty. Thought they had us beaten when they took out King. But the battle ain\\'t over till the black man sings. Words of Wisdom. The battle ain\\'t over \\'till the black man sings. Words of Wisdom. NIGHTMARE! That\\'s what I am. America\\'s Nightmare. I am what you made me. The hate and the evil that you gave me. I shine as a reminder of what you\\'ve done to my people. For four hundred plus years. You should be scared. You should be running. You should be trying to silence me. Ha, but you can not escape fate. For it is my turn to come. Just as you rose you will fall. By my hands. America, you reap what you sow. 2Pacalypse, America\\'s Nightmare. Ice Cube and Da Lynch Mob, America\\'s Nightmare. Above The Law, America\\'s Nightmare.

In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys. And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali. I'm in a daze and I'm so confused. Mike Boogie's next up. So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches. And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you. Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2.

I'll find a way out, yeah, I would if I could. But the government is doing a project. So I live in the projects. Where we fight for elbow room to the doom. Try to live long but you die too soon. I might not be alive to see 25. Met alot of skins and even made some friends. Cool, cause now I got a crew to run with. Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun with. The crime rate in New York State elevate. Drug wars daily, alot of blood spilt. Kids on the playground shot down and killed. Nobody wants to live on the first floor no more.

Some say that God is Black and the devil\\'s White. Well, the devil is wrong and God is what\\'s right. I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear. The rain ain\\'t gone, but I can still see clear. As a child, given religion with no answer to why. Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die. Curiosity killed the catechism. Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to. And became a slave to master self. A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health. My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons. Qur\\'an and the Bible, to me they all vital. And got truth within \\'em, gotta read them boys. You just can\\'t skim \\'em, different branches of belief. But one root that stem \\'em, but people of the venom try to trim \\'em. And use religion as an emblem. When it should be a natural way of life. Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain\\'t right. That\\'s who got you doing right and got you this far. Whether you say \"in Jesus name\" or \"Hum do Allah\". Long as you know it\\'s a bein\\' that\\'s supreme to you. You let that show towards others in the things you do.

I have taken and I\\'ve earned. I have laughed, I\\'ve cried. Sunshine, pouring rain. Found joy through all my pain. So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn\\'t earn. Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence. I\\'ve finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place. Cuz it\\'s hard to correct yourself when you don\\'t know who you are in the first place. But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do. Why\\'re we being lied to? I ain\\'t know our history was purposely hidden. Damn, something in me wanna know who I am. So I began my search, my journey started in church. Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets. Taught me survival from this evil I\\'m just gonna have to deal with. And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school. Takin elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran. Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites. Hold on, this ain\\'t right, Jesus wasn\\'t White. By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what\\'s been done to me but. I do know the Devil ain\\'t no White man, the Devil\\'s a spiritual mind. That\\'s color blind, there\\'s evil White folk and evil niggas. You gon surely find there\\'s no positivity without negativity. So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession.

Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college. Almost had a thousand dollars. 'Til someone broke in and stole it. And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart. And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart. Mom and Dad was arguing a lot, so Momma moved back. On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment. And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara. And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD. And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Momma out to see me. But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me. Then you started seeing Daddy on the TV. And Momma didn't like it. And you and Lainie were too young to understand it. Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit. And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it.

Did he put me on this Earth, just so I could die. I sit back and build on, all the things I did wrong. Why I'm still breathin, and all my friends gone. I try not to dwell on the subject for a while. Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle. But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries. And I can't turn it back it's a part of me. Too late for cryin, I'm a grown man strugglin. To reach the next level of life, without fumblin. Down to foldin I got no shoulder to lean on but my own. danger zone. Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse. Fuck the whole world kid my money comes first. Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody. If you're not family, then you die by me. Cause niggas will have you locked up the snitch'll be your man. Givin police the run down on your plans. We're never goin down like that. So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back. Illegal business, forever mine, fuck payin taxes. The last kid that shitted and gave police access. To my blueprints, used names as evidence. Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since. The moral of the story is easy to figure out. A lesson that you can't live without. \"},\n",

Like my man Luther jam, but my verse came first. I stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up. Outta the earth, . too morbid, lean forward. Toward a new paragraph, . Strictly that kush in the weed bags. Barry Gordie. Studio's smokey now. Davin Ruffin. Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her. Gotta' get your papes on, play on, playa. Before it's all gone, sip Don, tip waiters. Do y'all thing, m?nage, swing, baby. Spend dubs on your bruhs, gotta live crazy. Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose. Rubies in the Jesus piece, . pimped out like Snoopy. But a East Coast thing, . my girl's stocking. Tied up in a knot top of my bean head. Billion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals. Servin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's. No criminal, no mo', just mo' dough. girl performs cunnilingus. Barber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade. Hot towel on the face, . hot models who vomit. After they eat so they can stay lightweight. Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake. Come through like Mo Green from Godfather, . so clean. Where I step I 'Clorox it', . But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice. That's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil. Honey gave me a massage with a happy ending. Finest females, I just came on and sprayed her. But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue. What you never do is punk out, what you better do. Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view. Better yet, a better crew. Lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it. That man, that game, that thing it busts. In D-O-Double-G we trust. Yup, yup, young loc with the two steps. He creepin' with two TEC's, they sleepin' with two chicks. Right before we blast, all you heard was two clicks (Bloaw!). End of existence, for instance. Rewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it. Travel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo. I smoke the big leaf, end all the big beefs. My hair in two braids, I'm the big chief.

So please pardon these and such curious minds. Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone. The day of days, Yawm al-Qiy?mah. This tiny stone illuminated by a star.

Still at the top had to rock for the fame. Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came. You seen it all, how I got, how I gained. The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain. When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim. The streets, they made a special spot for my name. Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign. But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins. The pride and the pain. All the way back from the rise of my name. See the world clear through the eyes of the mane. See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave. When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane. The eyes that I played, the best to emerge in the game is the Watcher. [Verse 3: Rakim]. I'm Rated R, my brain contains graphics thangs.

I got that Esther, bitch I?m Redd Foxx. Big B?s, Red Sox,. I get money to kill time, dead clocks. Your fucking with a nigga who won?t give a fuck. Empty the clip then roll the window up.

YMCMB,. double M,. we rich forever. The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon\\' bang. Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint. Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch.

Everybody\\'s a killer, wow, we buggin\\' out. Since \\'86 showing the crowd what I\\'m about. And they still wanna know when the album coming out. Ask the teenagers, OG\\'s and nasty kids. What their definition of \"classic\" is. Timeless, so age don\\'t count in the booth. When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth. Ain\\'t no doubting the truth, I\\'m off the meters. Everybody cosigning, even non-believers. Since I came in the door . became one of y\\'alls leaders. In a fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers. Uptowns, we call \\'em uppies when they\\'re on divas. Probably worn when KRS-One teaches. Nas made you look before the heaters. I bet you Kan\\' had em on when he walked with Jesus. You can\\'t buy this Superfly-ness, . like a shine is. Your Highness is performing; look how long the line is. It\\'s what happens when you make shit that\\'s timeless. It\\'s what happens, these rappers is the pioneers. What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?. That\\'s so novice, I\\'m so polished. I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish. I did a lil bit of college. Semesters, it took two, like Rob Base. The beat\\'s slow, \\'til you listen to my pace. ?Cause I be killing shit, but that\\'s evident. And y\\'all feeling it, but I expected it. If it\\'s classic, it\\'s gon\\' last forever then. I\\'m everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been. Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest. Nas\\'ll rock well. Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper. To them, it hurts to hear this. Oh, you went platinum? Yeah, that\\'s nice. Now let me see you do the same thing twice. Three times, four times, then a couple of mo\\' times. Please, you\\'re Amateur Night, it\\'s Showtime. It\\'s one life to live, so live it the best you can. The world could use one less man. Not enough air, not enough car factories. To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans. When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain\\'t right. By the time you could afford it, the car ain\\'t important. In the streets I\\'m in, it\\'s just iron. Cops keep firin\\' in my environment. Leaving you slumped, then they drive home. Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on. I like to be the wall that they toast up on. I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong. I\\'m classic like the Air One\\'s, the hustler shoe. That\\'s what I\\'m accustomed to, yeah. \"Of course - we have Blastmaster KRS-One\". How many of y\\'all got Criminal Minded?. You, you, you; y\\'all don\\'t be blinded. Me, I got no jewels on my neck. Why? I don\\'t need \\'em, I got your respect. KRS-One, twenty years I rock. I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock. This hip-hop and we\\'s a nation. Don\\'t you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?. Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees. On the radio we need to hear more local emcees. This is the difference between emceeing and rap. Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal. Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people. Peace, Love, Unity, havin\\' fun.

I trust you dearly, I shoot blind. In time I clock figures, dropping niggas as we rise. We all soldiers in God's eyes. Now it's time for war; . never leave me, baby.

You're the reason I can stand tall; me and my girlfriend. All I need in this life of sin. Is me and my girlfriend. Down to ride to the bloody end. Just me and my girlfriend. I love finger-fucking you, all of a sudden I'm hearing thunder. When you bust a nut, niggas be ducking or taking numbers. Love to watch you at a block party, begging for drama. While unleashing on the old-timers, that's on my mama. I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors. The only girl that I adore, . everything I'm asking for. Talking to me, begging me to just take you around. Seventeen, like Brandy, you just wanna be down. Talking loud when I tell you be quiet. You move the crowd, . busting rounds, activating a riot. That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash. After a hit you, break apart, then back to one piece. Much love to my one and only girlfriend, . the world is ours.

Back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan. Someone put me out my misery, I can\\'t do this again. Mom, please stick to a decision, discipline,. last thing I wanna do is listen.

And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different. Music into the picture. and it became my new religion. \"I remember it clearly, even today\". Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan. Always itching for something to do. Was flipping through the radio stations one day and discovered. This DJ who was mixing,. I say it to this day, if you ain\\'t listened. To the Wizzard, you ain\\'t have a fucking clue what you was missing. I\\'d zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing\\'s wishing for shoes.

Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition. If we all band together, there ain\\'t no stopping this shit. Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and. Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision. If you got dissed at the Shop, cause if they caught you slipping. They\\'d take your spot if someone got to ripping you. And you forgot your written. Opportunity knocks once,. it ain\\'t knocking again. It tried ding-dong ditching shit, I fucking got that bitch in a headlock. Cut off his oxygen, Slim is not budging.

       "   'lyrics': \"Whatever. Haha, well, I'm with you, homie. Okay, let's handle the small shit. I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit. Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit. Grew up too quick, went through too much. Knew too much shit, corrupt. And I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch. Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth. Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth. 'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth. And if I fumble a verse, keep going. First take I make, mistakes, just keep it. No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit. Fake shit, . if I ever take shit I'll eat shit. Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane. Been here longer than anyone in the game. And I ain't got to lie about my age. (But what about Jermaine?) . Fuck Jermaine!. He don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name. And don't think I don't read your little interviews. And see what you're sayin'. I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked. When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it. You midget, mini-me . with a bunch of little mini-yous. Running around your backyard swimming pools. Over 80 million records sold. And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds. [Hook: Eminem]. ?Cause what you say is what you say. Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it. Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it. So who you playing with, huh?. [Eminem]. Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this. Amateurs drink veteran piss from a Dixie cup. If you ever mix me up. Or confuse me with a Canibus, or Dre with a Dupri. We'll rub it in, every club you're in. We'll have you blackballed. And make sure you never rap a-fucking-gain. Dre ain't having it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate. [Dr. Dre]. If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry. That could save it when I'm gone and buried. To make sure the tradition carries on, I would. [Eminem]. If I could only use this power for good. I wouldn't, not even if I could. [Dr. Dre]. From the hood, and I'm a hornet. And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered. [Eminem]. And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning. And swing to knock somebody's fucking head off. ?Cause I know if they get up. I won't get a chance to let off another punch. I'm punk rock, no one's punk. Don't give a fuck: white-Pac, so much spunk. When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'. Or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer. [Dr. Dre]. And I'm something of a phenom, . one puff of the chron'. I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again. There's no obstacle that I can't conquer. So come along with us, c'mon!. [Hook: Eminem]. ?Cause what you say is what you say. Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it. Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it. So who you playing with, huh?. [Dr. Dre]. Now anybody who knows Dre. Knows I'm about fast cars and Aliz?, partying all day. But I handled my business, ?cause it's work before play. Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet. However you want it, you can have it your way. You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day. Bullet with your name, sending it your way. That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway. ?Cause this is my space, you invade it. Live to regret it, and you'll die trying to violate it. Fuck around, get annihilated, . eyes dilated. [Eminem]. ...Like my old lady. ?Cause what you say is what you say. Sometimes what you mean is two different things. Depending on your mood if it swings. Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed. I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone. And I'm back, I speed write. And my loose leaf's my launchpad. [Dr. Dre]. And I can pull any string; don't have to prove anything. Catch a contract on your head. You headed West, talk shit about Dre. You better get a vest and invest. In something to protect your head and neck. And it's back and forth all day, like Red and Meth. I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth. But a lot of truth is said in jest. And if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death. Five mics in The Source, ain't holding my fucking breath. But I'll suffocate for the respect. 'Fore I breathe to collect a fucking check. [Hook: Eminem]. ?Cause what you say is what you say. Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it. Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it. So who you playing with, huh?. Watch your fucking mouth!. Yo, this Timbaland, tell him I said suck my dick!. \"},\n",

Nothing boosts me more or suits me beautifully. There's nothing you can do to me, stab me, shoot at me. Psychotic, hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic. Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada. God I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la. Oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da. but you gotta gotta. Keep moving, there's more music to make. Keep making new shit, produce hits to break. The monotony, what's gotten into me?. Drugs, rock and Hennessy. thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies. On your knees. Got you under siege. Somebody you would give a lung to be.

My son was very very much aware of that. He appreciated his station in life on the directions. In which he was going or traveling. On the other hand there were others. Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hating. And I think that is what resulted in his paranoia. If I had to change anything in my son's life. That would have allowed him to be here today. I would have deterred him from a career in music. I'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music. Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career.

He under thirty years old but already he\\'s a pro. Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll\\'. Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go. V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show. (Yes y\\'all) the best crib, the best clothes. Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze (say word). Checks with Os, o-o-o-o-ohs. Straight all across the globe, watch got three time-zones. Keep the digital phone up to his dome. Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes. One problem; even with the Os on his check. The po-po stop him and show no respect. \"Is there a problem officer?\" Damn straight, it\\'s called race. the jake. (woo-woo). Say they want you successful, but that ain\\'t the case. You living large, your skin is dark, they flash a light in your face. Now, who is cat dining out on the town. Maitre\\'d wanna take a whole year to sit him down.

They actions reveal how their hearts really feel. Like, late night I\\'m on a first class flight. The only brother in sight, the flight attendant catch fright. I sit down in my seat, 2C. She approach officially, talking about, \"Excuse me\". Her lips curl up into a tight space. Cause she don\\'t believe that I\\'m in the right place. Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped. All embarrassed, put an extra lime on my water glass. An hour later here she come by, walkin\\' past. \"I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph\". (Wowwww.. Mr. Nigga I love you, I have all your albums!..). They stay on nigga patrol on American roads. And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law. Some folks get on a plane, go where they please. But I go over seas and I get over-seized. London, Heathrow, me and my people. They think that illegal\\'s a synonym for negro. Far away places, customs agents flagrant. They think the dark faces smuggle weight in they cases. Bags inspected, now we arrested. Attention directed to contents of our intestines. Urinalyis followed by X-rays. Interrogated and detained \\'til damn near the next day. No evidence, no apology, and no regard. Even for the big American rap star. For us especially, us most especially. A Mr. Nigga VIP jail cell, just for me. (If I knew you were coming I\\'d have baked a cake). Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face. They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful. You start keeping pace, they start changing up the tempo. Now, who is cat riding out on the town. State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down. He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk. Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill. They gotta send it to the lab to make sure the shit is real. You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna. Woody Allen molested and married his step-daughter. Same press kicking dirt on Michael\\'s name. Show Woody and Soon-Yi at the playoff game, holding hands. Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black?. O.J. found innocent by jury of his peers. And they been fucking with that nigga for last five years. Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right?. Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white?. If white boys doing it, well, it\\'s success. When I start doing, well, it\\'s suspect. Don\\'t hate me, my folks is poor, I just got money. America\\'s five centuries deep in cotton money.

Aggravated assault, it was rap related, you activated a gunman. This game's over-saturated with junk and you punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint.

And, bitch, I'm hung like candy canes if you're wonderin'. Balls come at you like batting cages. I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm comin'. Like I'm ejaculating and nuttin'.

Goodbye (To the blocks). Goodbye (To the streets). I can't say goodbye (To the blocks). Goodbye (To the streets). Goodbye (To the hood). I can't say goodbye (To the hood). Goodbye (To the blocks). Goodbye (To the homies). I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out the homeboy. Plus my hood just lost another homeboy. Another one got locked, and we don't know. If he comin' home boy. The industry tell me, just leave it alone boy. Let them do them, take care of your own boy. But I sit back, think about, before I was grown boy. Then had dreams of bein' a doe boy. Yeah I was runnin' from the po-po, bangin' for the turf. Late night huntin', puttin' in work. Hood day comin', airbrushed shirt. Payday at the spot, got my haircut first. Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church. See I live in the 'burbs but I think 21st. I know since I've left that it's gotten much worse. But I'd still be there if I couldn't write a verse. To the blocks that raised me. The enemies and the homies that made me. Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me. Critics wonder if I'm tryin' to be the old me. But if they think the old me ever left. Then they don't really know me. And gon' know we don't change, we just become O.G. You always addicted to the life, you just don't O.D. But shit, I owe the streets before they owe me. Took me in when my mama didn't want me. Too wild to be her child, and pops not around. Now all I got now is the homies. To teach me, how to be a man and what not. How to break ounces into grams and what not. The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not. Shit, you think I forgot? Nah. Thank God every day that the boy could spit. And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit. I know I got plenty more awards to get. I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids. But it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit. That made me who I am, the music and the man. Told me that I can before the world gave a damn. If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan. Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand. Probably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man. They say leave the streets but they don't really understand. All I had was the block when I didn't have fans. Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins. All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids. If it all came down, my career was to end. I'm sure my name would live, in these streets. \"},\n",

It could be Nefretire come hear me and never fear me. I represent them teachers preachers comin through your speaker. Manifestin another lesson to them true believers. Instead of pickin up our women ready to mistreat \\'em. You better get yourself a wife and kid and never leave \\'em. The system will defeat \\'em if you don\\'t teach \\'em the cops\\'ll beat \\'em. The style that I be kickin quick is \"Edutainment\". Hip-Hop culture needed a teacher quick so I became it. Instead of rhymin about my history and what I been through.

It?s so challenging and fun and I?m surrounded by amazing people.. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I?m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don?t.. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion..

I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years.. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover.. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti?s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. I designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike.. Early 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult.. I still don?t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don?t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn?t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia.. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate. I guess some critics would joke that I still don?t know anything.. Being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively.. I appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy?s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical.. Good logic tells me ?smile Kanye?, the world likes you again.. ?Red or blue pill???aaaaand Swallow.. LOL. I wouldn?t have the prestige I have if it wasn?t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that. Hmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again?. Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim?the verdict is still out.. it?s got the best name ever?of all companies?of all time!!!. The name of the company is DONDA. DONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas.. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product.. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers. DONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford.. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy.. My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-).. The Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be?. I?m currently working on a new 7 screen experience?. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers.. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!. UNLESS YOU?RE A MATH MAJOR!!!. Allow kids to use search engines to do test?like the real WORLD!!!. please excuse my grammar?I know it?s extremely ironic. what about emotional IQ?s?. What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?. Excuse me?I just get excited at the possibilities?the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you?ll see?. When me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders. ?If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple?but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.? ?

Son of the most so from up high I shine. Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala. Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga. I?m the cum-lada, top of the class. Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash. From the windows that open, I?m raising my glass. This is my inception, I?m writing my dreams. Immortal view of a star doing what I?m born to do. I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through. [Hook: Makeba]. Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light. Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night. Now we in the skies, blue skies. And we going higher, that's right. It all started with a dream,. I wanted to be Run?D.M.C. The Lord put the blessing upon the MC. O to the M, dreams were spoken to him. That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim. Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for. To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or. D. Rose,. from the same streets that we rose. International heroes at world primos. Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president. Told him for health care, my music is the medicine. My name holds weight, I am never hesitant. Different state resident, this is hood elegance. SLS classic, pursuing my passion. NOVA Fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashing. Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh. Even now it don't seem so bad, ma. Close my eyes to see things in front of me. I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be. My broad up in Paris. I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through. I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere. I could see it from my window. Wouldn't take that long to get me there. Keep running til' I can go. Remember the beautiful things that life could give me. Crazy how I'm the one. Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air. With the wheels up staring at the sun. Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light. Ohh, until high we'll shine at night. Now we in the skies, blue skies. And we going higher, that's right. \"},\n",

In the beginning friends, we decided to roll. So who\\'s responsible when you get excited, explode. And Obie\\'s grinning, then you invite that Obie\\'s cold. But bitches they gon\\' talk, niggas they gon\\' hate. We established this way before we became mates. So what\\'s required is that you chill with all that fire. Get your desire when I retire, and. \"Spend some time with me, say that you\\'ll be mine\". I, never thought I\\'d find, someone to be mine. Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line. I used to say I never met a girl like you before. Still ain\\'t got a fucking clue as to who you truly are. Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters. \\'til you went as far as going and snooping through my drawers. Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for. Can\\'t believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore. You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours. All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls. If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad. When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off. But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off. It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on. You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we\\'d argue. And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me. And whoulda even knew that, who woulda even thought possibly. Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me. It\\'s true that I got shot in the heart. But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are. But see, when you\\'re in it it\\'s too hard to see. \\'til you pull up and see some other dude\\'s car parked and. Reach up onto the seat as your heart starts to beat. Before you make a decision that\\'s life altering. And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave. You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring. Ha ha, yeah right bitch. Spend some time with my dick. In most cases - Stat\\'s attitude is \"fuck a bitch\". My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch. But you was diff-er-ent, thought we shared a covenant. Even held your hand in pub-a-lic. we suffering because of this. Shorty on some whole \\'nother other shit. Trying to play slick, thinking I\\'mma trick off grip. I\\'ll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit. Feeding you the best of me. I shoulda fed you piss. We started off closer than close, but who coulda predicted to know. Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth. And the final result, back in that same boat. I asked myself, do I love these hoes? NOPE!. Em introduced us, 50 this is Tonya, Tonya this is 50. Then slid off and left her to kick it wit\\' me. I complimented her I said, \"you have very nice lips\". With my imagination, I could see her suckin\\' my dick. We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast. Had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass. Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline. Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind. She got to talkin\\' talking like an opportunist too. Why talk when suckin\\' my dick is the real career move. Said she\\'s an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice.

I don\\'t mean nobody harm, I\\'m just partyin\\'. I\\'m not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian. Just a man who\\'s on the mic. So let me entertain you. My lyrical content is constantly under fire. No wonder why I constantly bomb back. To combat attacks with constant concepts. When lyrics are constantly took outta context. Failure to communicate with Congress has. Been a problem for the longest, I guess. but. Maybe one day we can make some progress. Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest. Feeling good when I should be ashamed. Shit, I really should\\'ve fell but I stood, see, I came. Like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark. There\\'s a ray, there\\'s a light, there\\'s a hope, there\\'s a spark. But when planets collide they\\'ll never see eye to eye. Until they decide to set the differences aside. And this is why only one of us will survive. So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because?. My music can be slightly amusing. You shouldn\\'t take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing. Just trying to separate the truth from entertainment. It\\'s stupid, ain\\'t it? . I get sick of tryin\\' to explain it. See, I could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond. Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond. Cause I came here to uplift; let your woes be gone. Tell \\'em to get fucked and just mosey on. Constantly movin\\', constantly usin\\'. The Constitution as a form of restitution. Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant. Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams. I\\'ll be here when y\\'all are gone, rebuildin\\'. World revolving, still evolving, still Slim. How many kids will copy? Probably millions. But I\\'ma do this as a fucking hobby till then, cause?. My lyrical content contains subject matter. That sucks up all these fucked up young kids. At an alarming rate; . common denominate. Add it up and you\\'ll see just why I dominate. I try to stimulate, but kids emulate. And mimic every move you make, \"Slim, you great\". But wait, can\\'t you see I\\'m only here to entertain?. I gotta be the one to go against the grain. Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it\\'s inhumane. For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain\\'t. But they don\\'t understand that I\\'ve been through pain. If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain. But you can\\'t just stand there and try to judge. It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much. And it\\'s such a pleasure, every button that I touch. I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but. [Backmasked]. I\\'m not here to save you. I\\'m only here for the ride. So let me entertain you. And everything will be fine. '},\n",

Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, that ain\\'t me now. Got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks. Had to hire a team of workers, couldn\\'t play those streets.

Half of my staff had warrants. The other half in the casket lay dormant. I felt like life was cheating me. For the first time in my life I was getting money. But it was like my conscience was eating me. Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that. I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back?. Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad?. Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack?. Ain\\'t a whole lot of brain to that. Just trying to maintain a. stack. And not collide like two trains that\\'s on the same track. But get my life together like the oils I bring back. In the bottom of the pot where the water gets hot. Got my transporter take it across the border then stop. To set up shop with a quarter of rock. Here\\'s the plan:. For three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block. But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes. One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops. And this unstable way of living just had to stop. Half of my niggas got time, we done real things. By \\'94 became the subject of half of y\\'all niggas rhymes. Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit. But that\\'s the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit. The life and times of a nigga mind, excited with crime. And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind. I figured, \"shit, why risk myself I just write it in rhymes. And let you feel me, and if you don\\'t like it then fine?\". The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate.

Used to mix E&J with Ginger Ale. Sold crack when mom's drank pink champale. Now I'm in Anguilla on a ship that sails. Out the St. Maarten got them bricks in them mail. I don't play with the money cause the bread get stale. Rather sleep in a box 'fore I sit in a cell. I'm a gangsta, shoot me in the head if I tell. Last night watched TV but it watched me.

In case 52 broads come out. With a boss, bitch of course, S.C. on the sleeve. At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen. I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean.

The revolution, the revolution will be televised, televised, televised. It's time to rise, and take our place so we can inherit the universe. The planet Earth belongs to God. This is nineteen-ninety-seven. Every square inch of it that he chose for himself, is the best part. Behind every strong woman you'll find a strong man. And behind every strong man you'll find a strong woman. The universe is not completed without the sun, moon and stars. (Want to be free). That's man, woman and child. To all you fake-ass niggas who think you gonna survive out here. Without your Black woman, you're wrong. They have attraction powers on the planet. We are original man, the Asiatic Black man.

Making a total of nineteen million, four billion, four hundred million. All over the planet earth. (Mandela, Mandela). Arise you Gods, it's the time for the revolutional war. (Malcolm X, Malcolm X). That's the mental war. That's the battle between God and devil. Take the devil off your plane. Take him off your mental mentality, take him off your brain. Leave all the cigarettes and guns, the alcohol and everything. Thats the mental devil that exists within your body. That's destroying and decaying your mind. The mind controls the body. Everything within must come out. Don't look towards the sky cause there's no heaven above. Don't look down beneath your feet, there's no hell below. But heaven and hell exist within. Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through. There is only one God. There is a whole new one, faith. There is a only one. One revolution yeah. At one time it was told to me. That man came from monkeys. That we were swinging from trees. I hardly can believe that unless I'm dumb, deaf and blind. You ever heard about, the ape man and the ape woman. You have a mankind, that has a beginning to him. And his ending, is about to come. If you take one step, I will take one with you. Through the storm and pain, swim the deepest sea, with you my brother. Now the story is about to close. It was a hundred percent of us. That came on the slave ships. Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized. Poison animal eaters. They're slaves of the mental powers. They don't know who the true and living God is. And their origins in the world. So they worship what they know not. And they're easily lead in the wrong direction. Ought to be lead in the right. And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor. Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe. That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky. And you can't see him with the physical eyes. They're also known as blood suckers of the poor. And then you got the five percent. Who are the poor righteous teachers. Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent. Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is. And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia. Otherwise known as civilized people. Also Muslims, and Muslim's sons. I have given it much thought. It seems, disaster must come. At best, only postponed. Shaolin Kung-Fu. To survive must now be taught, to more young men.

And if ever need to cut a nigga music's my knife. And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dyke. So if I degrade it and I hate it, even cried through it. I watch brothers prophesise about dying through it. Music gave me knowledge of self. And I'm a knowledge-ous self, then gave me knowledge of wealth. Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over. The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me. guru. The redefining of space, you can call me the new geometry. A picture of you pop up when I google monotony. voodoo economy. But music is emotion that?s lost on the intellectuals. A tree fall in the forest is never heard. You download it for free but what I create is sacred. It cost you nothing but I pay to make it, trust me. I'm like Robert Johnson. When you reach the crossroads. Me and the devil have to meet.

Some get left behind and some get chosen. Just like life, Guns and Roses. Tote more Guns than Roses, foes is. Visibly shook of the invisible bully (let's go). Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain. In order to experience joy you need pain. Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain. You know the saying, somebody's lose is another's gain. The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain. A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again. Everything evens up, you just wait. Even a garbage can gets a steak. You ain't even a garbage can you have faith. But when it turns your way before it turns away. Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay. You'll get return in your investment if attention you pay let's go. (C'mon) It's the Roc (3X). (C'mon) That's right (C'mon). Life is all about Guns and Roses. \"},\n",

Disgruntled, had some struggles, yeah. But that passion and hunger\\'s back. What a fantastic juggling act. And the way I flip my tongue on the track. It\\'s like verbal acrobatics. But in fact. Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic. I fuckin\\' crashed my hovercraft. After I strapped a duffel bag to my back. And stuffed a massive punchin\\' bag in it. And an elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumb tack. And a piece of plastic bubble wrap. Went spastic and fuckin\\' snapped. Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid. Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped. And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat. And for my last trick, lunge on back. Latch on a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin\\' snap the rudder in half. Chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal. And just as I\\'m to come crashin\\'. I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress. And ceramic construction hat. Rub my magic mushroom tat. For luck then splat, get up from that. Face taped to a waste paper basket. Throw up then gasp, lungs collapsed. And that\\'s more likely than finding someone that\\'s. [Verse 3]. Couple of shots of J?ger. Public intoxication, dis-fuckin\\'-combobulation. Flooded with thoughts of anger. While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin\\'. \"You\\'re top ten ain\\'t cha?\" stop it, you fuckers are talkin\\' crazy. And stop interrupting you\\'re not even up in that conversation. Whether you\\'re punchin\\' a clock or famous. Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is. I give a fuck what\\'s your occupation. You\\'re thinkin\\' just cause you came in with scrubs. And you brought the scalpel and sponge. The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon. Stuck in the operating room. Once you done swapped your name with him. Smuggled in Ronald Reagan. If you dug him up; Donald Fagen. While juggling waffles, bacon. A fuckin\\' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it. Flung it across the table. Then bump it and knock it shake it. Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration. I said fuck it and lost my patience. They all woke up from sedation. Ain\\'t none of you Dr Dre. So then what is it got you thinkin\\'. You can fuck with this operation?. Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing. I\\'m still pluggin\\' along. No need for an assumption. Here\\'s confirmation. I\\'m up for the long duration.

New recruits, I\\'m fucking up MC troops. I break loose,. and trample shit, while I stomp. A mudhole in that ass cause I\\'m straight out the swamp. Creeping up on site, now it\\'s Fright Night. My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking dangerous. And more deadly than the stroke of an axe. Chopping through your back *swish*,. giving bystanders heart-attacks. Niggas try to flip,. tell me who is him. I blow up his fucking prism,. make it a vicious act of terrorism. You wanna bring it, so fuck it, come on and bring the ruckus. And I provoke niggas to kick buckets. I\\'m wetting cream,. I ain\\'t wetting fame. Who selling cain, I\\'m giving out a deadly game. It\\'s not the Russian it\\'s the Wu-Tang crushing roulette. Slip up and get fucked like Suzette. Bring da fucking ruckus.

For what people be talking \\'bout all the time. What we talking \\'bout fiction or we talking \\'bout fact?. You talking \\'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back. I\\'m talking \\'bout life and all I hear is:. \"Oh yeah he keeps talking \\'bout crack\". I ain\\'t talking \\'bout profit, I\\'m talking \\'bout pain. I\\'m talking \\'bout despair, I\\'m talking \\'bout shame. I ain\\'t talking \\'bout gossip, I ain\\'t talking \\'bout Game. I ain\\'t talkin bout Jimmy, I ain\\'t talking \\'bout Dame.

I\\'m doin\\' better than before, why would I do that?. Ain\\'t nothing cool about carrying a strap. Bout worrying your moms and burying your best cat. Talking \\'bout revenge while carrying his casket. All teary-eyed, bout to take it to a mattress. I\\'m talking \\'bout music, I ain\\'t talking \\'bout rap. You talking \\'bout who\\'s hot - I ain\\'t talking \\'bout that. The conversation is changed, let\\'s yap about that. I don\\'t run rap no more, I run the map. [Hook]. They talk, we live, we see what they say. They talk, We did, who cares what they say. Still they can\\'t\\' focus on them, they be talking \\'bout me. Talking \\'bout what I wear, talking \\'bout where I be. Check out my hair: these ain\\'t curls these is peas. \"Peasey head\" still get paid, I\\'m combin\\' through G\\'s. Please, we ain\\'t focused on naps. Cause I don\\'t run rap no more, I run the map. A small part of the reason the President is black. I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack. Talking \\'bout progress, I ain\\'t lookin\\' back. You know I run track - try not to get lapped. People keep talking \\'bout Hov left em flat. Try to re-write history, let\\'s talk about facts. Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps. He could\\'ve made more but he ain\\'t sign his contract. As far as street guys, we was dealing crack. That\\'s just how the game goes, I don\\'t owe nobody jack. Grown men want me to sit em on my lap. But I don\\'t have a beard and Santa Claus ain\\'t black. I repeat, you can\\'t sit on my lap. I don\\'t have a beard now get off my sack. Scream at me. Blueprint 3. And now that that\\'s that, let\\'s talk about the future. We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther. Now you could choose to sit in front of your computer. Posing with guns, shooting YouTube up. Or you could come with me to the White House - get your suit up. You stuck on being hardcore, I chuck the deuce up. Peace out. Medusa. Welcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah. Tre-piece,. Jay-Z your tutor. Tooter of my own horn beep beep. moo-ya. Ras clot when rude boy come through with the roof up. So I could see the sky. Cause everybody talking, Hov I think we know why. '},\n",

Heeeere we go.... Once upon a time not long ago. When people wore Adidas and lived life slow. When laws were stern and justice stood. And people was behaving like hip-hop was good. There lived a little boy who was misled. By a little Sha-tan and this is what he said. \"Me and you kid we gonna make some cash. Jacking old beats and making the dash...\". They jacked the beats, money came with ease. But son, he couldn\\'t stop, it\\'s like he had a disease. He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder. Set some R & B over the track for \"Deep Cover\" (187!). The kid got wild, started acting erratic. He said \"Yo, that presidential I got to have it...\". With liquor in his belly son, he made up the track. But little did he know that his joints was wack. The shiny A & R said \"Great new hit, G!\". \"Whenever you need a loop, yo come get me...\". The kid got amped and he starts to figure. \"I\\'mma get dough like all of these other niggas!\". So, he\\'s in the studio working round the clock. For pop radio, jacked the beat to \\'Planet Rock\\'. Was out in the street when he met this sister. Who couldn\\'t sing for shhhh but the mix would assist her. Hooked up the track and in excitation. He decided he\\'d head for the radio station. But (What?) he was running and he made a left. Was skeezing at top speed and ran into Mos Def. I slowed the young man down and I started: \"Yo money. Yo, why you selling lies to our wives and children?\". He ran upstairs up to the top floor. Opened up the door then guess who he saw? (Who?). Jane the chickenhead radio host. Who be yapping \\'bout beef between east and west coast. He said \"This one\\'s a bullet, you got to give it run!\". The chicken said \"Thanks\" and spanked it #1. Then he dipped into his ride, the 4-point Rover. Some cats with Hennessey saw him at a R-E-D. He winked his eye like his star status mattered. They rat-a-tat-tatted to make his blood splatter. \"You rocking crazy ice and all you do is cling static. And rolling out in Brooklyn late night is problematic...\". They told the kid \"Back down, that player shit is dead.\". Deep in his heart, he knew he was gone. But he grabbed his .45 and decide to blaze on. With shades on founded had him astounded and. Before long the young man got surrounded. Those grabbed the guns, so goes the glory. And this is the way I got to end this story. He was out chasing cream and the American dream. Trying to pretend the ends justify the means. This ain\\'t funny so don\\'t you dare laugh. It\\'s just what comes to pass when you sell your ass. Life is more than what your hands can grasp. Good night!. [Outro]. (kids talking). Knock \\'em out the box Mos, knock \\'em out Mos. Knock \\'em out the box Mos, knock \\'em out Mos (3x). . Knock \\'em out.... .

I guess well, that'll make my size double XL. So kiss your highness's hinded ass. While I'm trying to stretch, it's time to exercise. I'm flexing, isometrics. Twice the reps 'til I get extra-sized. And set my bi's and pecs and triceps on fire. Cause I'm coming out guns blazing. Like flaming pythons, my suggestion is parental discretion. Be advised, due to this mental aggression. We advise you to back up, like Byron Leftwich. I'm infectious, I rhyme like I got a sinus infection. A virus, I'm congested and I just ingested. Five Allegras but the side effects from these anti-depressants, they're tryna mess with my mind. I'm a regular Hyde and Jekyll. White with freckles but I silence hecklers. You might wanna head for the fire exits. I'm coming through like a wrecking ball. You would swear I think highly of Miley. And I respect her, the way I backhand her. Excuse my French, Montana, but I am worried about nutting. God damn it, I'm a sexist, I drive a Lexus. Textses out of her mind. and I'm in Texas. With a chainsaw, wait, what did I forget this.

And I just sweared like twice as many times. In less than ninety seconds. Than Andrew fucking Dice ever did in his fucking life. But I guess I'm expected to make these kinds of violent records. It's why I keep rhyming reckless. Fuck it, I swear, like a diamond necklace. Since freestyling over phone tap, my line's connected. With rhymes that kept in touch with the fans, that's why the more bars, the better my reception. And I give a fuck about sales, and fuck pop, I don't even like refreshments. Cindy Crawford tryna fend me off with a bendy straw. At the waffle house,. awful mouth. But if you don't like what I'm talking about then block me out. Just then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down. Kicks me and socks me, ow. Apparently still mad over what I said last year. On that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there. And try to act like I can't hear. What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear. That's when my man Denaun Porter ran behind me to pantomime. That if you wanna kick his ass, stand in line. Hands inside my pants as I fantasize taking advantage. Of Brandy and Janet by grabbing my Spanish Fly. Like a blind Hispanic guy with his zipper stuck. Give a fuck, it's all part of my grand design. To get Amanda Bynes to come and fucking blow me like a dandelion. Better watch your step, you 'bout to cross an outlandish mine. I'm what you get if Aaron Hernandez rhymed. So stand aside unless you plan to find out how handy I am with a branding iron. Fuck talking clear so you all can hear. I'd rather rap like a fucking auctioneer. Fuck around and walk from here to the Southpaw premier. Get on Paul's back, rapping Paul Revere. So call me queer, cause I'm always weird. So praise a Genius,. hope this don't get taken out of text. But Hillary, I promise to wipe my server clean if you face subpoenas. Got a name that speaks for itself like Anthony Weiner. Hands in between my pants in a theater, jacking my meat. A fan of Trina, Angelina, and Christina and Serena and Selena. Scarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen. Give me a damn good reason and not wanna slip an Ambien in the Cappuccino. And try to have a 3-sum with Janet Reno. I'm fucked worse than Donald Trump. On Lexapro in Mexico across from a Texaco in McDonald's drunk. Broke and out of gas, busted water pump. Getting fondled up by Ronald, feeling him on his rump. Oh yeah, and me and Alyssa Milano hump. We do. Bringing the horror to emcees like the aura of the Run DMC fedora. Addidas and Diadoras but I need at least three to four of those Rita Oras. In a four seater Taurus but tell them my face is the best seat in the house. I?ll let them bleed in my mouth while I?m eating them out (that?s disgusting, ow Jesus). Heat seeking missile, duck, demented, sick, hate and see who gives a fuck. I invented prick, and that?s a true statement, I see the bitch in you Caitlyn. I keep the pistol tucked like Bruce Jenner?s dick. No disrespect though, not at all, no pun intended, that took a lot of balls (ay God damn). Oh and Azealia Banks just wanna tell you thanks.

Sodomy, how many chocolatey jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity. No wonder you scoff at me, it?s still obvious I?m as off-putting as Bill Cosby is. Treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe. S?s,. I?d probably stalk broccoli. yes it?s. Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine.

Befo' Steve Jobs made the iPod. Was gettin' head jobs, we call that intimate. Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette. With a automatic weapon I was rappin' with a Tec. Fresh like Mannie be, chain like anti-freeze. Shoebox full of cash, dealer man hand me ki's. Pantries full of Arm & Hammer, don't take Nancy Drew to see. What it do, I'm a damn G. Just sent a million dollars through a hands free. That's big money talk, can you answer me?. Before the answer was a 3. I was down in Georgetown with a Hoya chick, lawyer chick. Sure he's rich now cause he saw the shit, all this shit. That's why they call him Hov', cause he came before all this shit. Bought a 6, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights. Bought a 9 for non-stop Glock work all the time. Woo! Guess who's back?. Since this is a new era, got a fresh new hat. Ten year veteran, I've been set. I've been through with this bullshit game but I never quit. I used to think rappin' at 38 was ill. But last year alone I grossed 38 mill'. I know I ain't quite 38 but still. The flow so Special got a 38 feel. The real is back, hehehehe. \"},\n",

Just like a passenger, hurry and fasten your seatbelt. Cause I'm about to start broadcastin. The words of wisdom, so turn up the system. Loud and clear, I don't want no one to miss one. Word to be heard never blurred or slurred. The preferred is absurd, all the damage that's occured. As I break MC's like a lumberjack. I'm not the type of MC to be merciful. So if your name ain't Jermaine take it personal. Cause like a vigilante I'm gonna kill off any. Sucker MC that tries to withstand me. All competition flee and start goin in. The other direction, run for protection. Cause I can burn an MC like an erection. You're too small kid, don't get involved with. The verbal law for the Nation of Islam. Wisdom I speak makes your head nod. Showin I got the power, and that's from bein born the God. But many doubt my Knowledge of Self. But they're just illiterate, so I don't consider it. Feedin off poison that's pollutin their mind. I gotta maintain, accelerate my brain. And god damn, it's hard being the Kane. This is the proper way man should use ink. But you're at your brink and your rhymes are extinct. Just like a dinosaur, but you never find a more. Cause mine'll keep sellin on wax like some kind of whore. Saw this style of rap kickin like Chuck Norris. But this ain't Kung-Fu, no I just brung you. A style, that phony MC's were too young to. Digest, when I manifest, you adolescent. So sit back, relax, be glad you had a lesson. And this one's for your listenin pleasure. Somethin for all the bitin MC's to treasure. Just like a diary, for you to admire me. Before you're put in the Dead Poet's Society. I laugh as the wrath break in half, your whole staff. But many MC's were able to retreat. Runnin like an athlete, but I got bad feet. So I don't chase ya, nor do I wait to face ya. Nah it ain't in my nature. I just rip shop, flip-top, and watch MC's get dropped. As I manifest in hip-hop. Rhymes I construct are tough like a Tonka truck. That's how I build and destroy. The poetic printer, rough rhyme inventor. With a groove so smooth you can't help but get into. Cause I can bake an MC like Chef Boyardee. Holdin my own on the microphone. Cause I break bones just like sticks and stones. So let it rain let it rain as I put em in pain. God damn, it's hard bein the Kane!. Cause I came to blaze a taste of bass of grace. A replace, erase the waste without a trace. My vocabulary will just have you very. Dazed and amazed so I fear no adversary. They can't even touch this, even with ammunition. Break out the gauge and go into an outrage. And I'mma still blow up the stage. Cause this is a death threat, but don't let your sweat get. In the way of your vision don't be missin when I get set. To go on a rampage, start a one man rage. Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage. And leave it in ruins from the damage that I'm doin. To prepare the atmosphere, as I put you in. The mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow. And so... I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried. To get fly and face the ace I put em in place. Proceed em, retreat em, defeat em, delete em, and feed em, and eat em. And all the rest of that good stuff, cause I don't need em. Only one survivor can remain. And god damn, it's got to be the Kane!. \"},\n",

I wish some of these killings. They could be prevented. Whatever happens it was written. But during ya life you put ya heart in it. Even though it seems we being targeted. Let that brother R hit it. Dreamt of plushed out pads. How many in my crew is into gaining. Subtract the weak links about the chaining. Rise it start raining. Blasphemy using Nas' name in vain. Everything I tried to learn see, I already knew (that's right). And it's embedded in my heart now. I saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise. Put a gun to me hungry he went on to chastize. That's Nas ain't it, made it rich from entertainment. Fresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with. Yo perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on yac. Or was I marked for a contract for some foul act. I did a while back or beyond that. You got me laying face flat. Saying my grace black, woke up in a cold sweat. Yo, I hate that. Nightmares, feeling real. word to Will. My A-Alike I lost in the battlefield. That's why I hit the mic with mad appeal.

And think you\\'ll sink into the rhyme like quicksand. Holds and controls you \\'til I leave. You fall deeper in the style - it\\'s hard to breathe. The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then. Bring \\'em to the front \\'cuz my rhymes\\' the oxygen. Then wave your hands - when you\\'re ready I\\'ll send you. Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue. And so on and I\\'mma go on simultaneously. And even if I stop - the rhyme remains to be. Rising to the top - and I came to drop it. I draw a crowd - like an architect. The five borroughs react and all the islands attract. And every state can\\'t wait - so they attack. Off a spot on the floor - squeeze in cuz it\\'s packed. It\\'ll be more room if MC\\'s play the back. I\\'m the R the A to the K-I-M. If I wasn\\'t, then why would I say I am. The microphone fiend if I was a fake. Whoever said it\\'s just buggin\\' off the rhymes I make. I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite. Sung it on stage some said it don\\'t sound like. The voice on the record - I see what you mean. Because the system was wack, so I had to scream. So just - give me a mic if it\\'s loud I\\'ll blow it. If not - into the crowd I\\'ll throw it. Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well. Before I let go I\\'mma spark your brain cells. I took time to write - tonight I will recite. So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight. MC\\'s are knowin\\' that\\'s why they\\'re goin. Home to tell a friend when the party ends. \"Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again\". Cuz mic by mic and stage by stage. Tape by tape and page by page. When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix. The rougher the cuts - the rougher the rhyme gets. Deeper and Deeper. I hope you understand it. I made it up myself and I planned it. For other MC\\'s who waste time. Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme. I cross my arms and I was waiting - but I was hating. The rappers on the microphone was fronting - just faking. They wasn\\'t breakin\\', which means I was achin\\'. To get up on the microphone and then start takin\\'. Control of the mic. So hug the speaker- your ear\\'s a magnet. Attracted to a freestyle put in effect. You listen to the man while you\\'re sippin\\' Moet. So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight). Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little. I want you to hear this perfectly clear. Catch what I\\'m sayin\\'? You get the idea?.

Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out. My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones. 'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones. That's a union that nobody could touch. I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles. Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit. Court cases, baby mamas. I make a honest woman outta you yet. Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin. Heart poundin out my chest like a canon. I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it. But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful. I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true. Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO. Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to. I'm getting married. \"},\n",

A young wild beautiful love child. You like them thug style. link rockin. mink. coppin. Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin. The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine. Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick. You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit. Chanel lookin real. airbrushed nails. Hit the gym, hit the scales,. your ebony tone is lockin me. The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me. Wishin I could be the one man. but you juggle. Way too many Willies all in one hand. You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on. Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear. Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there. But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars. Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out. Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas. Niggas thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave. What up mah, frontin like you naive. Push your man's whip. calling police when you flip. Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us. But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!. Diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine. Pretty little face, get a little high. Young girl stugglin, tryin to survive. Mother of the Earth, she made you and I. Just tired of playin the same ol' games. Messin with my mind, emotional thangs. And there goes.. a black girl.. lost. Isis. she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless. Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest. To who'sever gettin down and trifless. To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceles. Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs. More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah). There you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours. Seem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours. Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you. Igloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen. To this nigga spendin Franklins on tennis anklets. Must've had a bad deal in the past though. Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow. Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain. You got a job part-time and school's your night thing. With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now. You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed. Typical day that the black girl sees. Comin home wantin more from a college degree. Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is. Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless. Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you. Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin to. More than the world, but not knowin nothin about you. You leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to. Drop them off, lettin some nigga knock you off. So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed). Growin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to. Everything that move be inside you. Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you. I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to. They spot you out dancin topless in your drawers. Damn look, there goes a. black girl lost. You should be ashamed of yourself. The way you carry yourself. The way you hang out all night long. Doin silly things that is wrong. Black girl. \"},\n",

I enter Central Park, it\\'s dark; it\\'s Winter in December. I see my target, put my car in park and approach a tender. Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her. Sit down beside her like a spider,. hi there girl, you mighta. Heard of me before. see whore, you\\'re the kind of girl that I\\'d. Assault and rape then figure why not try to make your pussy wider?. Fuck you with an umbrella, then open it up while the shit\\'s inside ya. I\\'m the kinda guy that\\'s mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder. Impregnate a lesbian, yeah, now let\\'s see her have triplets. And I\\'ll disintegrate them babies as soon as they\\'re out her with formaldehyde and cyanide.

There\\'s a monster inside of me, it\\'s quite ugly and it frightens me. But they can\\'t see what I can see, there\\'s a vacancy in my tummy. It\\'s making me play hide-and-seek, like Jason I\\'m so hungry. She\\'s naked, see, no privacy but I can see she wants me. So patient, see, I try to be. but gee, why does she taunt me?. Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep. I creep right through the front. See, so blatantly but silently cause I know that she\\'s sound sleep. \"Who\\'s waking me so violently and why\\'s he on top of me?. He\\'s raping me,\" she tries to scream, \"Somebody please get him off me. He\\'s taping me, he\\'s biting me, he\\'s laughing like it\\'s funny\".

Or Satan, gee what a sight to see, I\\'m dancing in my red panties. I\\'m crazy but it\\'s all right with me, man life can be so empty. Stay away from me cause I\\'m dancing to quite a different drumbeat. Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart.

Pray for light of day right away,. why do they try to fight today?. I must make them pay twice as much,. might as well put the knife away. Now I use power tools, how \\'bout now,. are you in the shower?. Scour you for 6 hours \\'til outage of power outlets. How did you figure out I was down in your basement, now ya. Musta just heard the sound of my stomach growling from down there. Prowler, there\\'s no one fouler; bound ya, that\\'s how they found ya. Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya. Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower. Jump out on you now like I was Jawa from fucking Star Wars. Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye, beddy-bye-bye, it\\'s time to die-die. Ought to not even bother to scream, it don\\'t even matter. Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya. Not your everyday Damien,. bathe me in holy water. Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there\\'s no gun in hand. Where\\'s the thrill in the hunt, there\\'s no fun in that. here I come with axe. Fun to act like lumberjack when I\\'m hacking \\'em up with that. What was that?

The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White. We had to grow dreads to change our description. Two cops is on the milk box missin\\'. Show they toes, you know they got stepped on. A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon. Runnin\\' from the police, picture that. Nigga, I\\'m too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack. That\\'s why I bust back, it don\\'t phase me. When he drop, take his Glock, and I\\'m Swayze. Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight. Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker. [Verse 2 - 2Pac]. It\\'s on me, but still I\\'m having memories. Of high speed when the cops crashed. As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast. We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart. In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?. Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes. No hesitation in extermination of these snitches. Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me. A couple of movies, now the whole world\\'s tryna to screw me. Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?. But stay true, sippin\\' 22\\'s of brew. And now media is trying to test me. Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me. Misery is all I see, that\\'s my mind state. My history with the police will shake the crime rate. My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped, he screamed \"Thug Life!\" and emptied the clip. Got tired of runnin\\' from the police. They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast. [The Notorious B.I.G.]. I was more shocked than anything, you know what I\\'m saying?. But I wasn\\'t more shocked of him dying. I was more shocked of him. Pac is a strong dude, yo. I know dude, you know what I\\'m saying? Real strong. So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, \"Again?\" you know what I\\'m sayin\\'?. He always getting shot, or shot at. He going to pull through this one again. Make a few records about it, and it\\'s going to be over. You know what I\\'m saying? . But when he, when he died. I was just like, \"whoa\", you know what I\\'m saying?. Kinda took me by. I mean even though we was going through our drama. I would never wish death on nobody, you know what I\\'m sayin\\'. Because there ain\\'t no coming back from that. '},\n",

Will I succeed? . Paranoid from the weed. And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can\\'t see. And in my mind I\\'m a blind man doin\\' time. Look to my future, ?cause my past is all behind me. Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?. Everybody\\'s dyin\\', tell me what\\'s the use of tryin\\'. I\\'ve been trapped since birth, cautious ?cause I\\'m cursed. And fantasies of my family in a hearse. And they say it\\'s the White man I should fear. But it\\'s my own kind doin\\' all the killin\\' here. I can\\'t lie, ain\\'t no love for the other side. Jealousy inside, make \\'em wish I died. Oh my Lord, tell me what I\\'m livin\\' for. Everybody\\'s droppin\\', got me knockin\\' on Heaven\\'s door. And all my memories of seein\\' brothers bleed.

Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror. And leave notes around for yourself to remember. I like to teach and build. With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil. All you need is some skill. Then it?s grindtime. Imagination better than knowledge, ask Einstein. Nasty the nicest. Just one minute after it's heard, you all will recite it. You all will repeat it, you'll call me a genius. If you didn't now that I said it I forced you to think it. Write in my little vignettes. sipping Moet. When I was young they called me Olu?s son. Now he?s Nas' father, I was the good seed. He was the wise gardener. Beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas. Conservatives don?t understand slang linguistics. The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness. Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness. So what I rap about my riches and I?m ostentatious. Get out a gangsta?s business, seems to me your thoughts are basic. Try to compare what you live to the life I master. See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after. golden Egyptian faces.

I pass it, you gaspin\\' for breath and you die fast. Gut \\'em like a gastric bypass. But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role. Since 16 I ain\\'t grow a day old yet my brain grow. Cocaine white Range Rov\\'. Tats on my body like an art exhibit. I did real good for a project nigga. Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it\\'s Chandon. Fat blunts in the car with strippers. Guns in compartments hidden. I was real young little youth, a novice nigga. Blessings, bowed down, respected. Chowed down, now my food\\'s digested. Techs. That\\'ll bust louder than the noise that I just spit. Let\\'s get one thing straight that my crown ain\\'t for testin\\', testin\\'. Chop heads off like King Henry VIII. Guillotine to ya neck bitch. I\\'m a king in this thing, don\\'t be dumb. Been in this shit since \\'91. Niggas can\\'t fuck with the style I use. Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum. Calm now, was a wylin\\' dude. Studied cowards. and made power moves. Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food. You can say that\\'s how I move. A monster nigga, and I don\\'t really like doing songs with niggas. There go my nigga Wayne. Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say. \"We ain\\'t got time to respond to niggas\".

Put greed in our heart, it?s the green that we want. Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!. They say I?m underrated, but un-compete-with-able. Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable. Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!. And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!. They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end. See now they nominated a nigga to come and. Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run. And they be knowin\\' that I be blackin\\' on everything. And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun. I gotta make it what they want and wake ?em when I come.

Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I?m done (DAMN!). You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich. And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!. Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick. What the fuck you niggas still hangin\\' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?. Okay, now enough of that, see now I?m out the door.

Hear my angels singing to me (are you happy, Hov?). I just hope I\\'m hearing right;. karma\\'s got me fearing life. Colleek are you praying for me?. See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way. If the prophecy\\'s correct, then the child should have to pay. For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays. In hopes that she\\'ll be okay. And when I\\'m no longer here to shade her face from the glare. I\\'ll give her my share of Carol\\'s Daughter. and a new beach chair. [Hook: Chris Martin]. I hear my angels sing. Life is just a dream and you really don\\'t wanna wake up, wake up. Life is but a dream and you really don\\'t wanna leave. Life is just a dream and you really don\\'t wanna wake up, wake up. Life is but a dream and you really don\\'t wanna leave. Life is but a dream to me. Gun shots sing to these other guys. But lullabies don\\'t mean a thing to me. I\\'m not afraid of dying, I\\'m afraid of not trying. Every day hit every wave like I\\'m Hawaiian. I don\\'t surf the net, no,.  I never been on MySpace. Too busy letting my voice vibrate. Carving out my space in this world of fly girls. Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls. Benzes round corners where the sun don\\'t shine. I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one\\'s grind. Some said: \"Hov, how you get so fly?\". I said: \"from not being afraid to fall out the sky\". My physical\\'s a shell so when I say farewell. My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell. So have no fear, just know that. Life is but a beach chair. Life is but a dream. Can\\'t mimic my life. I\\'m the thinnest cut slice. Intercut, the winner\\'s cup. With winters rough enough to interrupt life. That\\'s why I\\'m both saint and sinner, nice. This is Jay everyday, no compromise. No compass comes with this life just eyes. So to map it out you must look inside. Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you, chica. Your coraz?n is what brought us home. In great shape like Heidi Klum, Maric?n, I am on. Permanent vacay. life is but a beach chair. This song is like a Hallmark card until you reach here. So \\'til she\\'s here, and she\\'s declared. The heir, I will prepare. A blueprint for you to print. A map for you to get back. A guide for your eyes, and so you won\\'t lose scent. I\\'ll make a stink for you to think. I ink these verses full of prose. So you won\\'t get conned out of two cent. My last will and testament I leave my heir. My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair. '},\n",

Be used as extra topping then next time I make a pizza. How many people you know who can name every serial killer. Who ever existed in a row, put them in chronological order. Beginning with Jack the Ripper. Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper. Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped. The trunk that they was stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate. And which model, which lake they found her. And how they attacked the victim. Say which murder weapon was used to do what on which one. Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun. Don't stop, I like this it's fun, the fucking night's just begun. When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like. You're stuck with the same stick that you're trying to light. Behind the boards, it's Dre, legends are made this way. Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?. Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms. Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some. He can give her some, she can give them some. Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome. The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and penning some. Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of. Capable of winning a Pulitzer, so unbelievable, it's a. Titanium cranium that's full of surprises. When the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes. You stare into your stereos (high). Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing. I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking. \"},\n",

Wither and break, you slitherin\\' snake. Gibberin\\' fake, fibber and flake. I\\'ll twist you into a different shape. And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake. If this is a dream, you wish you can wake. Every diss you can take, personal. We ain\\'t friends trying to make amends. If you ain\\'t ever stole a gate you can take offense.

Man I wish I had my Glock cause its major. Im making shanks out the plastics in razors. These motherfuckers won't, leave me alone thats my word. 'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfucking murder. Im making collect calls to my old bitches. Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches. To all the suckers on the block, talking shit while I was locked up. Be prepared to be socked up. Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief. And you bullshitting bitches ain't changing me. I came straight up out of gutta' I was saved from hell.

And the dope man had an AK. Said he'll spray and he's not jokin'. Well it seems to be the dopefiend. Owed the dope man for his product. And he swore if he did not pay. He would end up getting shot up. Now I could not walk away. Cause I got caught up in the scene. Wondering what would happen to this. Poor and helpless fiend. Well my homie, Michael Cooley. Said let's go and make our order. What's the use in watchin' two men. Stand out here fight over quarters. While I walked inside the diner. And all the Dope Fiends waived to me. Heard the sound of several gun shots. And I ran outside to see... (What's Going On?). Another gun shot rings (What's Going On?). Another siren sings (What's Going On?). Another mother cries (Yo what's Going On?). Cause another innocent died (Yo what's Going On?). Another gun shot rings (What's Going On?). Another siren sings (What's Going On?). Another mother cries (Yo what's Going On?). Cause another innocent died. All the people in the diner. Ran outside to see the big show. It was just another party. For them to see just who they would know. But for me I held concern. I wanted to see the outcome. Would the mother see her son tonight. Or would she live her life without one?. I made it to the streets I. Almost cried right on the spot. Not only had the fiend died. But a small girl had been shot. My heart could take no more. I felt a tear roll down my face. That was daddy's bullet. But she took it in his place. Tried to make my way through the crowd. So I could go help the baby. She could barely speak. But she whispered. Mister could you please save me. So I screamed out, someone help me. But I dont think they could hear. And if they did, they didn't care. Oh how I hated everyone there. The baby lie here dying. And I wondered what could I do. The camera men and newspapers had come. To get their interviews. To them it's just a story. And they can't see the tragedy. To them it doesn't matter. Cause it ain't it wasn't their family. I don't think I'll be back. Cause it'll never be the same here. So I wipe away the tears. And leave the scene the way I came here. Though some people say it's crazy. And the food could have been finer. I'll never forget, never forget the night. At Dopefiend's Diner. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.... \"},\n",

Nigga, I told ya, put fear in your heart. Fuck up the party before it even start. Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk. On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks. Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun. And have fun with Jamaican rum. My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist. and. We\\'re smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking. If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking. Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm. She grabbed my arm and said \"Let\\'s leave calm\". I\\'m hitting skins again. Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken. Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out. Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out. [Music stops, indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing. Biggie breaks it up yelling \"Yo chill, man, chill!\"]. Can\\'t we just all get along?.

War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'. Every night it was like a cop would get killed. Body found in the dumpster. For real a hustler, purchased my Range. Niggas throwing dirt on my name.

To teach those who can't say my name. First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller. Rakim gets stronger as I get older. Constant elevation causes expansion. I write my rhymes while I cool in my mansion. Then put it on tape and in the city I test it. Then on the radio the R is requested. Whoever's out of hand, I'ma give 'em handles. Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles. Or should I just let 'em melt?. Now I'm a stop to see what you got. Get off the mic before I get too hot. Now if you're from Uptown, Brooklyn-bound. The Bronx, Queens, and Long Island Sound. Even other states come right and exact. It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at. Since you came here, you have to show and prove. And do that dance until it don't move. Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release. The rest is up to you, Rakim'll say peace. \"},\n",

Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em. H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A. For sheezy my neezy. my arms so breezy. Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me. Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy. Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in. But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky. H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A. Not guilty,. he who does not feel me. Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist. So poof! -- vamoose, son of a bitch!. [Hook]. H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A. For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA. H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A. That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!. H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A. Not guilty y'all got to feel me. H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A. That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!. I do this for my culture. To let them know what a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster. Show them how to move in a room full of vultures. Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over. Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up. I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush. Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us. We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks. Hov is back, life stories told through rap. Niggas acting like I sold you crack. Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov did that. So hopefully you won't have to go through that. I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats. Smokers out back selling their mama's sofa. Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave. Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk. Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?. Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law. So you know I seen it all before. I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight. To try and to fail: the two things I hate. Succeed, and this rap game: the two things that's great. H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A. What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy. \"},\n",

Time to be this great - uhh - so just wait. Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are 5th-place. And I\\'m just grace one uno ace. And I\\'m trying make your heart beat like bass. Hmm mm, but you\\'re sweet like cake. And I come to fix whatever you shall break. Where is your originality? You are so fake. So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say. All I need is one mic. all I need is one take. Like hey! brighter than the sun ray. Got a pistol on a playground: watch the gun-play. Like: no, kidding, no kids in the way. But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say. Gotta work everyday gotta not be cliched. Gotta stand out like Andre 3K. Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei. You gotta have faith you gottta gotta. Wait wait I think I, I think I lost him. (*Flatline*). Okay respect is in the heart so that\\'s where I\\'mma start. And a lot of heart patients don\\'t make it. But, hey, kid. Plural, I graduated. Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it. And that was called recycling. Or re-reciting something. Cause you just like it so you say it just like it. Some say it\\'s biting but I say it\\'s enlightening. Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest. And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest. And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest. Arthritis in my hand from writing. But I\\'m a doctor they don\\'t understand my writing. So I stopped writing now I\\'m like lightning. And you ain\\'t Vince Young so don\\'t clash with the Titan. Fast and exciting my passion is frightening. Now let me put some more vocab in your I.V. Here take this Vicodin like it and love it. And confidence has no budget. So pay me no mind. I don\\'t walk it like I talk it cause I run it. I don\\'t do it cause I done it. And I\\'m in the emergency unit. God dunnit I\\'ve lost another one. (*Flatline*). [Lil Wayne talking with female nurse]. [FN] Good evening Dr. Carter it\\'s been a long day. But this one looks much better than the others. His respect is back up, concepts sound good. His style is showing strong signs of improvement. All he needs now is his swagger. Okay let me take my gloves off then. Swagger tighter than a yeast infection. Fly go hard like geese erection. Fashion patrol police detection. I stay tight like Chinese Connection. I stay tight like pussy at night. Baby don\\'t get me wrong I can do that pussy right. But I\\'m too wrong to write. too fresh to fight. Too paid to freestyle too paid to freestyle. Had to say it twice swagger so nice. And don\\'t ask me shit unless it concern a price. And I don\\'t rap fast I rap slow. Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes. Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats. That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat. Wait, as I put the light down his throat. I can only see flow his blood starting to flow. His lungs starting to grow this one\\'s starting to show. Strong signs of life where\\'s the stitches here\\'s the knife. Smack his face his eyes open I reply \"What a night\". Welcome back hip hop I saved your life. [Female nurse talking]. [FN] He looks good, his vitals are up. He\\'s looking good he\\'s looking good. I think we got one Dr. Carter I think we got one. Yep yep we got one we saved him he\\'s good. He\\'s good we got one he\\'s good. (*Heart beating*). He\\'s good, we got him. We saved him, he\\'s a go. He\\'s good. '},\n",

Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto. Tall white tee?s, can?t believe we used to wear those. White folks looking at us like we?re weirdos. But we was only kiddos. Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittle. Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle. Tryna get to Diddy, cause I murder instrumentals. This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson. Fucked then I?ll pass,. y?all Utah Jazz-in'. And ya?ll borin?,. I don?t play nigga, I?m Mark Madsen. Thats why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian. I?m not asking my nigga I don?t need favors.

They throwing up them bricks, you better box out. My niggas got enough white to build Barack house. I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein. .44 on my waist, Rick Ross jeans.

Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, that's pimples. I?m bout to go banana puddin?. You a dyke cause your man a pussy. Hit you from the blindside, no Sandra Bullock.

Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood. Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?. Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga. That's why we go to thug mansion. That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G. [Verse 1: 2Pac]. A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind. So much pressure in this life of mine. I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide. And woulda tried But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes. No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble. Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you. Picture me inside the misery of poverty. No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived. Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on. Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on. We found a family spot to kick it. Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit. A spot where we can smoke in peace. And even though we G's, we still visualize places, that we can roll in peace. And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast. I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion. Every corner, every city. There's a place where life's a little easy. Little Hennessy, laid back and cool. Every hour, cause it's all good. Leave all the stress from the world outside. Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go). Nothing but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga). And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion. A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide. Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by. No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets. No reason, for nobody's momma to cry. See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter. But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her. This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me. Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe. Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'. I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother and. I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy. I dream of you more. my love goes to Afeni Shakur. Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war. And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more. Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne. Every corner, every city. There's a place where life's a little easy. Little Hennessy, laid back and cool. Every hour, cause it's all good (at thugs's mansion). Leave all the stress from the world outside. Every wrong done will be alright. Nothing but peace, love. And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion. [Verse 3: 2Pac]. Hahaha, Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good. Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods. Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook. Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke. Then some lady named Billie Holiday. Sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came. Little Latasha sho' grown. Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home. Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us. When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band. Just think of all the people that you knew in the past. That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last. Picture a place that they exist, together. There has to be a place better than this, in heaven. So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'. Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion. Every corner, every city. There's a place where life's a little easy (at thugs's mansion). Little Hennessy, laid back and cool. Every hour, cause it's all good. Leave all the stress from the world outside. Every wrong done will be alright. Nothing but peace, love.

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side. Staying alive was no jive. Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man. So then we moved to Shaolin land. A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth,. 'Lo goose. Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot. And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one and that one. Pulling out Gats for fun. But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend. Started smoking woolas at 16. And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes. Making my way on fire escapes. No question I would speed for cracks and weed. The combination made my eyes bleed. No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all. Sticking up white boys in ball courts. My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater. Times is rough and tough like leather. Figured out I went the wrong route. So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out. Catching keys from across seas. Rolling in MPV's. every week we made forty G's. Yo nigga respect mine or here go the TEC-9. Ch-chick-POW,. move from the gate now. [Hook: Method Man].

It's been twenty-two long hard years of still struggling. Survival got me bugging, but I'm alive on arrival. I peep at the shape of the streets. And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep. A man with a dream with plans to make cream. Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen. A young buck selling drugs and such who never had much. Trying to get a clutch at what I could not. The court played me short, now I face incarceration. Pacin' - going upstate's my destination. Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us. Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough. But as the world turned I learned life is hell. Living in the world no different from a cell. Every day I escape from Jakes giving chase,. selling base. Smoking bones in the staircase. Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess. I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed. But I'm still depressed and I ask what's it worth?. Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth. Who explained working hard may help you maintain. To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain. We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks. Stray shots. all on the block that stays hot. Leave it up to me while I be living proof. To kick the truth to the young Black youth. But shorty's running wild, smoking sess, drinking beer. And ain't trying to hear what I'm kicking in his ear. Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted. That what? That life is hectic.

Now tell me who is the man?. And stepping to me, thinking I can be touched?. Not even Michael Jordan\\'ll gamble that much, yo. Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia. fake as a cubic zirconia. Look inside my rap book at every text my man. And see that I got, more essays than the Mexican. Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant.

And those who talk don't know a thing. Men are born soft and turn tough. Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God. I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart. By the beast but he missed his mark. Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up. When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all. Yo it came to me, the pain in me. Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be. Day by day by day I sit back and pray. My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage. They pass away, they went off the casket way. My gats will spray, but that won't bring em back today. The team we got left on the set, now turn to me. Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind. I ride past the church where they got his body and find. They takin him to the hearse to put his body in dirt. That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt. Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution. As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses. Saw the enemy, I ate him,. saw Jakes behind me. They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin me. trees. Little girls have seeds by O.G.'s in the hood. coke to sniff. Dope to ooze in your blood. But it's good in the hood. duck strays.

Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin\\' out . the block. For distances, . givin\\' long kisses BITCH!. Only understand, I say a prayer for you. You know, that?s the only thing I can do, just pray for your mind. Because, see, your mind is in control of your heart. Where its supposed to be the other way around. Your heart has got to control your mind. So now, I have no feelings for you. You have made me cold. Frank White the menacing, Chron Chron\\'s the medicine. I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin. Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer. Then, drugs and MAC-10s. Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you. Be broke -- girls won\\'t date you. That\\'s why I relate to, choke yo\\' ass out til your face blue. Make you, open the safe too. No matter how you call it (how you call it). This brolic, alcoholic. Like his weed green\\'d out, like his brick solid. Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine. Drink Ballantine, all the time. Slugs hit your chest tap you spine, flatline. Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo\\' times. Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though. Sling steel slow, as for remorse, we feel no. [Outro: Puff Daddy]. See the fucked up thing is that I love you. You know what I?m saying. It?s just in my nature to love you. I can?t hate you. ?Cause its not in my nature to hate you. You know, I don?t know. Maybe I?m a different type of individual. But you have me on a line. And there?s a thin line between love and hate. And God-forbid I cross that line. Cause I?m not gon? give a fuck. I?m telling you right motherfucking now. The shit that ya?ll done started. Is never gonna stop!. We are never gonna stop!. And we?re not talking about no other rappers. We?re talking about you, motherfucker!. You know who I?m talking to. We comin\\' for you. We comin\\' for you. Feels so good. I\\'ma make you love me baby, baby. '},\n",

Yeah and can we have another moment of silence. For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence. From here to the Dark Continent where rebels sell diamonds. To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying. And can we please pour some more liquors. For Will,. Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas. Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan. It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on. Street's Disciple,. salute to those who's gone with bullets. And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest. And can we please have a moment of truth. For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots. And families back home who pray they make it home safe. Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles. This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you. Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you. And can we please have a moment to mourn. For Pac, Biggie and Pun, cause through us they live on. Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah. Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya. or trapped in the system. Who never knew their father, never learned to dream. But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends. For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad. Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had. For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get em signed. So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime. For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding. Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking. To let the ones we really care about know that we love em. \"},\n",

       "   'lyrics': 'A hardcore, life, I chose to explore. Therefore I lived raw and went to war with the law. My only picture was a mug shot. Slugs what thugs got. Pockets swellin\\' hot from sellin\\' tops on the drug spot. Gs was clocked, fat knots went in the socks. And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock. Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike. Cause I choose to use a gun don\\'t mean that I can\\'t fight. Cause we could put the guns down and go one round. With the hands my man, I ain\\'t the one, you\\'ll get done clown. I can inverse my style cause I\\'m versatile. Quick to burst a child, I\\'m livin\\' worse than foul. I pack two tecs in case your crew flex. I wet up the set in a sec and yell \"Who\\'s next?\". To feel the wrath of a psychopath, shoots it up like Shaft. Turn your staff into a bloodbath then laugh. You\\'ll get smashed like a deli snack. You\\'re softer than jelly jack. I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat. On one three ninth street, Malcolm X boulevard. It\\'s full of hard brothers that\\'s thick and quick to pull a card. I tell facts when the beat start. Listen here sweetheart. The Big L is street smart. I fuck ducks and they crews up. Make \\'em give the jewels up. For those who refuse I squeeze the uz and light them fools up. I had beef with this nigga named Randolph. Now he\\'s in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed. A beat down from Big L, that\\'s what all pranksters get. Like Al Yankovic, I\\'m on some real gangster shit. I\\'m never fuckin\\' with no handicapped or crippled bitches. Look at my scalp real close and you\\'ll see triple sixes. Crimes I committed, I\\'m a villain admit it. I\\'m the type to murder you then tell your moms I\\'m the kid who did it. Peace and love is somethin\\' that I don\\'t rhyme about. Fuck what you heard, you know what I\\'m about. Knockin\\' niggas off, knockin\\' niggas out. Knockin\\' niggas off, knockin\\' niggas out. Knockin\\' niggas off, knockin\\' niggas out. Knockin\\' niggas off, you know what I\\'m about. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-g9biX7RUA4zMEa8Csv6sFw\"); });Knockin\\' niggas off, knockin\\' niggas out. Knockin\\' niggas off, knockin\\' niggas out. Knockin\\' niggas off, knockin\\' niggas out. You know what I\\'m about!. It\\'s the man with the rough flow. Some niggas don\\'t like me but I don\\'t give a fuck though. Cause I\\'m in command y\\'all. I\\'m smackin\\' niggas up like Puerto Ricans play handball. I ain\\'t the funny type, to joke around I gotta get my motherfuckin\\' money right. Cause I got the right game, definitely the wrong man to invite to a dice game. I\\'m rollin\\' numbers with no practice. I\\'m snatchin\\' up the dough like motherfuckers owe taxes. Cause I got strategy. I\\'m rollin\\' head crack trips and makin\\' all the brothers mad at me. Word, I\\'m taxin\\' shit. I\\'m shittin\\' on niggas like I just had a laxative. Tryin\\' to earn props I ain\\'t the one to see. You clowns\\'ll fuck around and get played like a drum machine. Ya gotta find a better way. I\\'ll pull ya card, your file, shit, plus your resume. Cause I don\\'t play clown. I gotta get mine that\\'s why my face stay frown. I don\\'t smile, don\\'t try to pull my file. I\\'ll lay your ass like towel, you know my motherfuckin\\' style. So just slow down cause y\\'all can\\'t throw down. And y\\'all can\\'t accept that a nigga\\'s makin\\' dough now. And I\\'m livin\\' better troop. And I\\'m makin\\' more noise than a fuckin\\' heavy metal group. I\\'m a cool man, a brother with a smooth plan. That\\'s why I\\'m seein\\' more papers than a news stand. So peep it, don\\'t try to run around or speak it. Point blank I keep my whereabouts secret. While niggas are packin\\' steel, actin\\' ill. I\\'m on the D.L. with a female and I\\'m stackin\\' bills. How I\\'m livin\\'? Everything is well. Cause a nigga like me, yo, I\\'m ringin\\' bells.

But you won\\'t take the sting out these words before I say \\'em. Cause ain\\'t no way I\\'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem. When I say I\\'ma do something, I do it, . I don\\'t give a damn. What you think, I\\'m doing this for me, so fuck the world. Feed it beans, it\\'s gassed up, if it thinks it\\'s stopping me. I\\'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably. And all those who look down on me. I\\'m tearing down your balcony. No if ands or buts, don\\'t try to ask him \"why?\" or \"how can he\". From Infinite down to the last Relapse album. He\\'s still shittin\\', whether he\\'s on salary, paid hourly. Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him. Whichever comes first, for better or worse. He\\'s married to the game. Like a \"fuck you\" for Christmas; his gift is a curse. Forget the Earth, he\\'s got the urge. To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe. I\\'m not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We\\'ll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just letting you know that you\\'re not alone. Holla if you feel like you\\'ve been down the same road. Okay, quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap. I shouldn\\'t have to rhyme these words. In the rhythm for you to know it\\'s a rap. You said you was king, you lied through your teeth. For that fuck your feelings. Instead of getting crowned you\\'re getting capped. And to the fans, I\\'ll never let you down again, I\\'m back. I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact. Let\\'s be honest, that last Relapse CD was ?ehhhh?. Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground. Relax, I ain\\'t going back to that now. All I\\'m tryin\\' to say is get back, . click-clack BLAOW. ?Cause I ain\\'t playing around. There\\'s a game called circle and I don\\'t know how. I\\'m way too up to back down. But I think I\\'m still trying to figure this crap out. Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn\\'t. This fucking black cloud still follows me around. But it\\'s time to exorcise these demons. These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now. I\\'m not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We\\'ll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just letting you know that you\\'re not alone. Holla if you feel like you\\'ve been down the same road. And I just can\\'t keep living this way. So starting today, I\\'m breaking out of this cage. I\\'m standing up, I\\'ma face my . demons. I\\'m manning up, I\\'ma hold my ground. I\\'ve had enough, now I\\'m so fed up. Time to put my life back together right now. It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me. Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you. So I could come back a brand new me. You helped see me through. And don\\'t even realize what you did, believe me you. I have been through the wringer. But they can do little to the middle finger. I think I got a tear in my eye, . I feel like the king of. My world, . haters can make like bees. With no stingers, and drop dead. No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise. To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father. So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof. Like my daughters and raise it. You couldn\\'t lift a single shingle on it. ?Cause the way I feel, I\\'m strong enough to go to the club. Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up. ?Cause I\\'m raising the bar, . I\\'d shoot for the moon. But I\\'m too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing, . and I\\'m?. I\\'m not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We\\'ll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just letting you know that you\\'re not alone. Holla if you feel like you\\'ve been down the same road. '},\n",

There\\'s never been a nigga this good for this long. This hood or this pop, this hot or this strong. With so many different flows, this one\\'s for this song. The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up. These fucks too lazy to make up shit: they crazy. They don\\'t paint pictures, they just trace me. You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked. Their whole style from - then try to reverse the outcome. I\\'m like: \"TAA!\". I\\'m not a biter, I\\'m a writer for myself and others. I say a B.I.G. verse, I\\'m only Bigging up my brother. Bigging up my borough--I\\'m big enough to do it. I\\'m that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish. So them rings and things you sing about, bring em out. It\\'s hard to yell when the barrel\\'s in your mouth. I\\'m in new sneakers, dual-seaters. Few divas, what more can I tell you?. Let me spell it for you:. W I, double-L, I-E nobody truer than H-O-V. And I\\'m back for more, New York\\'s ambassador. Prime Minister, back to finish my business up. What more can I say?. What more can I do?. I gave this up to you. I know this much is true. You already know what I\\'m about: flying birds down South. Moving wet off the step, purple rain in a drought. Stunting on hoes; brushing off my shirt. But ain\\'t nothing on my clothes except my chain, my name. Young H-O pitch the yay faithful. Even if they patrol, I make payroll. Benz paid for, friends they roll. Private jets down to Turks and Caicos. Cris\\' caseloads, I don\\'t give a shit. Nigga, one life to live, I can\\'t let a day go. By without me being fly, fresh to death. Head to toe \\'til the day I rest. And I don\\'t wear jerseys, I\\'m 30-plus. Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups. S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete. What more can I say? Guru, play the beat!. Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag. For like half a billy. and your ass ain\\'t lily-White. That mean that shit you write must be illy. Either that or your flow is silly. It\\'s both!. I don\\'t mean to boast, but damn, if I don\\'t brag. Them crackers gon\\' act like I ain\\'t on they ass. The Martha Stewart that\\'s far from Jewish. Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it. And no I\\'m not through with it. In fact, I\\'m just previewing it. This ain\\'t the show, I\\'m just EQ\\'ng it. One-two and I won\\'t stop abusing it. To groupie girls: stop false accusing it. Back to the music -. the Maybach roof is translucent. Niggas got a problem Houston!. What up B, they can\\'t shut up me. Shut down I, not even P.E., I\\'mma ride. God forgive me for my brash delivery. But I remember vividly what these streets did to me. So picture me letting these clowns nitpick at me. Paint me like a pickany. I will literally kiss Ti-Ti in the forehead. Tell her, \"Please forgive me,\" then squeeze into your forehead. I\\'m not the one to score points off, in fact. I got a joint that\\'ll knock your points off. Young Hova the God, nigga. Blast for me. I\\'m at the Trump International: ask for me I ain\\'t never scared. I\\'m everywhere, you ain\\'t never there. And nigga, why would I ever care?. Pound-for-pound, I\\'m the best to ever come around here. Excluding nobody, look what I embody:. The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street. A CEO\\'s mind, that marketing plan was me. And no I ain\\'t get shot up a whole bunch of times. Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines. And I ain\\'t animated like, say, Busta Rhymes. But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines. Add that to the fact I went plat\\' a bunch of times. Times that by my influence on pop culture. I\\'m supposed to be number one on everybody list. We\\'ll see what happens when I no longer exist.

Don Juan. ill trife con. Write hype shit, my gang can make a dyke like dick. And my crew bigger than your crew twice as thick. Niggas be lookin\\' for some ice to stick. Nice and slick. My man L got 25 to life taught me life\\'s a bitch. Said hold your head \\'Gruff son and write them hits. [Big L]. Ya\\'ll niggas like to stress them hoes. Impress them hoes. And spend money to dress them hoes. I sex them hoes and send them home. Corleone is known to be stoned. When I bone I\\'m rubbered-up \\'case the bitch full blown. The other night around 8PM. Pockets crazy slim. Jumped out the grey B.M. Went to the ATM. Took a thou\\' out. Later on had to wil\\' out. In the club knocked some nigga and his pal out. Afterwards went to the restroom and pissed Cristal out. Cause it\\'s L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real. I got more dimes than that Sprint lady, that\\'s ill. Playa hatas be givin me harsh looks. But I\\'m trying to sell records like Garth Brooks. So fuck \\'em all. When it\\'s cold I throw the skully on. Illegal chips keep my celly on. Mega ice is what I\\'m heavy on. If it ain\\'t Cristal bitch I guess it\\'s P?rignon. Try to tax, watch the 9 mil\\' burst. I\\'ve been off the scene over two years and niggas is still thirst. To hear Big L drop an ill verse. All you unsigned niggas that wanna battle, get a deal first. I sport the bullet-proof fitted hat. That attitude you better get rid of that. Where ever you floss is where you gonna get it at. I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel. Makin\\' figgas while you broke niggas keepin\\' it real. L is rap most livest cat. I\\'m getting stacks while you askin\\' niggas - \"Do you want fries with that?\". I rob fags in the stair case. No mask, bare face. The one police wouldn\\'t dare chase. Keep my gear laced. Do I walk around without papes?. No way pal. Word up, my money longer than the O.J. Trial. Yo, I rhyme with my heart and my soul. Shine like a carton of gold. Got M.C.\\'s startin\\' to fold. Leave \\'em cold. Better play their part and their role. Leave \\'em shook like a hustler with knocks on the stroll. What you know about slangin\\' in the park in the cold. Puffin buddha with your buddies. Gooses and the skullies. Rockin\\' Tim\\' boots and all the honeys. And when it\\'s sunny. We sport linen spending money. Of course we some men who hungry. Society forced us to attend to ugly. And scorin\\' like Bugsy. I rather die than keep the feds cumfy. I read Nicky Barnes. yeah plus I read Bumpy. Harlem World\\'s where I\\'m from see. Picture \\'Gruff comin\\' clumsy. I\\'m from the home of the money maker bum is junkie. DJ Clue pull up something funky. I\\'m kinda of tired off this weed and this Brass Monkey. Uh. Ears studded out. Playa hatas cut it out. Chain flooded out. Sexin\\' hoes tell I\\'m nutted out. You on the mixtape, talkin \\'bout you flip weight. You fishcake holdin\\' your dick and still couldn\\'t piss straight. I got heavy dough. And that\\'s something that you already know. Clue heard me once and said \"I bet he blow\". I rock the Presi\\' Rol\\'. You want beef let me know. I be in Mexico chillin\\' with a sexy ho. How cool can one MC be?. Ya\\'ll still envy me cause I\\'m M.V.P. Cruise through Harlem in a bullet-proof MPV. Man, you fuck around and get plugged like MTV. I\\'m a pretty pimp with mad gear. I put my hoes on the moon if there was cash there. You feel me?. I buy hot jewels and ice it down. While you go to the jewelry store with short dough trying to bring the prices down. '},\n",

Rosey, won't you come out to play. A nuisance, wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers. Making shrines of my crimes and capers. My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends. Go to Europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stirred em. You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him. The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'. Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins. Crazy turn of events that he emerged, took over the world. And reeled in all the children, lured em into the building and killed em. Buried em in the mulch and mildew. drawn to gold like Rumpelstiltskin. Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol - three pills. The Real Slim Shady's entered the building. There's nothing but crumbled leaves and. Tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid. He's ill wit it, he still shouldn't be heeled. There's no one as sick as he MC's.

Everybody get up, sit up Christopher. They're miserable without you, Superman is a-. Live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River. Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before. One, two, three, four, five, six, this uh. Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser. How did anybody ever find me I disa-. Peared I was hiding in Freeway's beard,. just a. Hop, skip and a jump from my skin gushing. Nails into my face that I been pushing. Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion. It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a. Sucker like a vice grip, my pen put you. In the slaughterhouse cause your style's been butchered. I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on, my brains on. Hyper drive, someone put the brakes on. [Eminem & Mr. Porter]. Here's a smidget, a midget to get your digits. Bridget. Don't try to fidget with it,. ribbit ribbit.

Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget. baby you could throw a Frisbee in a blizzard. He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he, he's a wizard.

Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka. Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor. six o-. Clock in the morning. Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget. Ayo, just so everybody knows. That was a hook we made on the way to the radio station. And we were trying to get it right. So we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever.

But look at me now, ten years deep. Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep. I never asked to be top of rap\\'s elite. Just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets. But look at me now. Sugar man. Now wait a sec, give me time to explain, women and fast cars. And diamond rings can poison a rap star. We?re suicidal, high, smoking so much lye. I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky. Wish I could flap wings and fly away. To where black kings in Ghana stay. So I could get old my flesh rot away. But that\\'ll be the day when it\\'s peace. When my gat don\\'t need to spray. When these streets are safe to play. Sex with death, indulge in these women. Envision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire. Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina. Like the Exorcist,. then they gave birth to my seeds. I beg for God\\'s help, why they love hurting me?. I\\'m your disciple, a thug certainly. I\\'m the N, the A to the S-I-R. If I wasn\\'t I must\\'ve been Escobar. 45 in my waist,. staring at my reflection in the mirror. Sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion. When everything around me got cloudy. The chair became a king\\'s throne,. my destiny found me. It was clear why the struggle was so painful. Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to. And God, I\\'m so thankful. '},\n",

Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl. I can no longer play stupid or be immature. I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage. Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words. Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge. Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred. Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third. I am no longer scared now. I'm free as a bird.

You see that brick house right there? That\\'s the nigga\\'s crib. When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up. Imma get in the other car. Aight. Car revs up. Gunshots. [Hook]. If there\\'s beef cock it and dump it. The drama really means nothing to me. I\\'ll ride by and blow ya brains out. There\\'s no time to cock it, no way you can stop it. When niggas run up on you with them thangs out. I do what I gotta do, I don\\'t care I if get caught. The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court. I\\'ll kill you. I ain\\'t playing, hear what I\\'m saying, homie, I ain\\'t playing. Catch you slipping I\\'mma kill you. I ain\\'t playing, hear what I\\'m saying, homie I ain\\'t playing. [Verse 1]. Keep thinking I\\'m candy \\'till ya fucking skull get popped. And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box. In the hood summer time is the killing season. It\\'s hot out this bitch that\\'s a good enough reason. I\\'ve seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding. Saying \"Lord, Jesus help me\" cause they ass leaking. When they window roll down and that A.K. come out. You can squeeze ya little handgun until you run out. And you can run for ya backup. But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up. God\\'s on ya side? Shit, I\\'m aight with that. Cause we gon\\' reload them clips and come right back. It\\'s a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked. I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier then Lady Luck. Look, nigga, don\\'t think you safe cause you moved out the hood. Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain\\'t good. If you was smart you\\'d be shook of me. Cause I\\'d get tired of looking for ya, spray ya mama crib. And let ya ass look for me. [Hook]. My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can\\'t wait to get to you. Behind that twinkle in ya eyes I can see the bitch in you. Nigga, you know the streets talk. So they\\'ll be no white flags and no peace talks. I got my back against the wind. I\\'m down to ride \\'till the sun burn out. If I die today I\\'m happy how my life turned out. Locked up I was in a box by myself. With a pistol I define the definition of pain. If you survive ya bones\\'ll still fucking hurt when it rain. Oh, you a pro at playing battleship? Well, this ain\\'t the same. Little homie this is a whole different type of war game. See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains. Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains. After the fist fights it\\'s gunfire, boy, you get the best of me. If you don\\'t wanna get shot I suggest you don\\'t go testing me. All the wrong I\\'ve done the Lord still keep on blessing me. Fin\\'nin to run rap cause Dr. Dre got the recipe. Yeah, uh ha, aye Dre. You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker. Cause my windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof, nigga. Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga. Cause my motherfuckin hat is bulletproof, nigga. But the Doc said if I get hit I might get a fucking concussion. Better that then a hole in the head right, nigga?. '},\n",

She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em. When you meet me in person what do you feel like?. I know, I know I look better in real life. I hear people compare themselves to big a lot. You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot. I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G. Any one: Big Pun, Big L or Notorious. 'Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious. And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit. These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory. \"},\n",

Confidentially speaking in codes since I sense you peeking. The NSX rental, don\\'t be fooled, my game is mental. We both out of town, dog, what you trying to get into?. Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables. Meet me by the one that starts a G up. This way no Fraud Willies present gambling they re-up. And we can have a pleasant time, sipping margaritas. Ge-ge-gyeahh. Can I live?. Can I live?. [Verse 2]. My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle. Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it\\'s sure to hurt you. Dual level like duplexes, in unity. My crew and me. commit atrocities like we got immunity. You guessed it, manifest it in tangible goods,. platinum Rolexed it. We don\\'t lease, we buy the whole car, as you should. My confederation, dead a nation, explode. On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient. When it boils to steam, it comes to it. We all fiends, gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this. True, this the streets school us to spend our money foolish. Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders. I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist. Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin\\' cream. \"Let\\'s do this!\" It gets tedious. So I keep one eye open like CBS. You see me stressed right?. '},\n",

But if this is all there is for me, life offers. Why bother even trying to put up a fight? It's nonsense. But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience. What about them rhymes I've been jottin'. They are kind of giving me confidence. Instead of trying to escape through my comics. Why don't I just blast a little something, like Onyx. To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that. Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him. Grab hold of my balls like that's right, fight's on bitch.

Snook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home. From Attica. known, for keepin chrome calibers. Smooth like a Wallaby shoe. He\\'s out to get it, five years plannin to blow, soon as he hit the bri-dicks. Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low. Played the crib for a month, and. deaded his P.O. Started robbin niggas til he caught a whole kilo. He had a bunch of starvin niggas he owe, he never paid though. Got large, sign on his door, \"Don\\'t knock hard\". Layin with his bitch, niggas is rich, is what he told her. Played the block, holdin\\' cracks inside the baby stroller. Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it\\'s over. A year went past, Snook went flossin fast. His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash. I seen death, seen thugs cry, it\\'s bugged why. We let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull. Another thug died, pitchin your soul, into that infinite. Black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo\\'-fo\\' blast. Snook was one of em, so many more. Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job. He was close to her, ever since she took him inside. When his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five. It\\'s real tendencies, when you feel your enemies. But can\\'t figure out whose who, keep it true. Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never. Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar. '},\n",

The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin (3X). [Hook: Vinia Mojica]. Things I say and do, may not come quite through. My words may not convey just what I'm feelin. Knowledge Of Self is like life after death. With that you never worry about your last breath. Death comes, that's how I'm livin, it's the next days. The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page. Yo they askin me how old, we livin the same age. I feel the rage of a million niggas locked inside a cage. At exactly which point do you start to realize. That life without knowledge is, death in disguise?. That's why, Knowledge Of Self is like life after death. Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest. Different day, same confusion, we're gonna take this. Hip-hop shit and keep it movin, shed a little light. Now y'all bloomin like a flower with the power of the evident. Voices and drums original instruments. In the flesh presently presentin my representation. Things I say and do, may not come quite through. My words may not convey just what I'm feelin. The most important time in history is, NOW, the present. So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence. These people into cloning like Gattaca. They tryin to lock you down like Attica. , the African diaspora. Represents strength in numbers,. a giant can't slumber forever. I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever. Aiyyo I heard you twice the first time money, get it together. You must be History, you repeatin yourself out of the pages. You keepin yourself depleatin your spiritual wealth. That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention. Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention. The young, gifted and Black are sprung addicted to crack. And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear. With, broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration. You get out of jail with that Knowledge of Self determination. Stand in ovation, cause you put the Hue in Human. Cause and effect, effect everything you do. And that's why I got love in the face of hate. Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight. Infinite like figure eight there's no escape... Things I say and do, may not come quite through. My words may not convey just what I'm feelin. This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica.

I still don?t understand award shows, I don?t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don?t understand it bro. I don?t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don?t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro!. Two thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art ain\\'t always gonna be polite.. Y?all might be thinking right now, I wonder, did he smoke something before he came up here? The answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off.. I don?t know what?s gonna happen tonight, I don?t know what\\'s going to happen tomorrow bro.. But all I can say to my artists, my fellow artists, just worry how you feel at the time man, just worry about how you feel and don?t never, you know what I?m saying, I?m confident, I believe in myself.. We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality.. We not gonna control our kids with brands..

The hole in the ozone layer's outta control. But they wanna fight for more oil and gold. Unemployment, I got laid off. The streets is the last resorts to get paid off. For more, more mint, no dough for rent. I gotta shed blood to make a red cent. Maybe I should ask the president. Somebody get me the president. But he don't want to hear it, it's out of the question. Cause in my section it's worse than recession. So I go to a rich neighborhood and play Robin Hood. Take from the bad and give to the good. Bensonhurst. Cause I need government and they need government. A lot of mint spent, now I gotta pay rent. dead presidents. in the projects. You're gonna get robbed and wrecked. I parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot. Let's get him for all he got. I approached him slow like I was a basehead. four-fifth. You see those kids over there with the hoods. Walk to 'em real slow and give them the goods. First the gun and the dough and crush the jumbos. One false move and no one knows. Show them the light, teach them right from wrong. Understand the words in this song. Can't be done when we're gone, so. Teach the children, save the nation. They're corrupt, and their time's up soon. But they'll blow it up and prepare life on the moon. Sounds like Total Recall. But who gotta spaceship, you get it, we fall. So hope for the best and expect the worst. The end is near and it's U-N-I verse. The one's that interfere with nature. Labeled you limited and underrate ya. His plans over rule when he separates ya. Now it's U-N-I verse, the one that hates ya. So we gotta let them know we're hip to the script. Change the skit, or we're about to flip. Cause we want access to happiness. Living the good life and much success. Equal opportunity. Teach them the abacus and their culture. And that'll help stop the robbing, raping and killing. Poison neighborhoods are illing. But they import more keys from across seas. A drug disease hits the streets with ease. So keep on building. cause we gotta keep building. Til the answers are filled in. And make sure you don't stop till then. And if you do, remember the children. \"},\n",

Before we learn to fly? Somebody else should try. Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change. So I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold. I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe. Communities in need of people that will lead. Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try. Until the day I die, I promise to be wise. With my heart open, greed brings only misery. Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free. Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise. Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die. For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise. Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies. We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate. Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight. Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes. Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate. ?Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take. And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate. To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes. You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes. But we ain't, its grain to go against. With every artist comes the image he portrays. And the picture that he paints. But in the midst of all this anger and this angst. Never once did you heard me say I'm a gangster. And I ain't hear no complaints. But I know that I will always continue to grow. As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow. There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee. To this day, the game will never be the same. No matter how much fame and success they attain. There will never be another me. And no matter what they do, there will never be another you. You can search, but you'll never find. You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds. We will never die, we are forever alive. [2Pac] And we continue growin', one day at a time. Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype. Rappers are regular people minus money and lights. Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom. All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest. There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'. And the kids think beef is they only option. Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged. My memories took a dive, my Machiavelli lives on. You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns. And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come. So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?. We needing a change, the drama remains the same. I spend my whole life fightin' myself. That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help. And hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts. I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt. Yeah, that there is a fight in itself. So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself. No matter how much I try, stay alive. I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride. Heard frivolous beats, we past that. I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in. And collect on my ASCAP. The rappers in the game ain't changed. And I finally realize that we're not in the same game. The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it. Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it. The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier. Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers. They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us. So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'. One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind.

And that's how it is, that's how we live. Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days. Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say. I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me. That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty. We too gritty, like Sanford and Son. Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on. See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs. You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs. Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on. We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm. Silent wars or we silence the fours. Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho. Now it's movies and soundtracks. This is where your career stop at. Ayo I drink to that. I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me. You violate, they read your obituary in front your family. You should idolize Nas in the flesh. Don't wait til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt. We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers. Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger. Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit. Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes. O.T. commute back and forth. Tell shorty get that package off. Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit. Caught a case then I beat the shit. D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets. Big White boys with guns yelling, freeze Black kids. Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus. Wishing they was on the blocks with us. To watch me and P do it, put the heat to it. Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it. Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music. And think deep to it, now who the truest. Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out. I daydream of better days, in different ways. Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth. Even though we gained cash on fish. I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich. And I'mma be that same nigga for the door. And I'mma still walk the same path, we soon clash. We get stacks, you do the math. We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh. Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid. Rap niggas shit they drawers. [Verse 4: Nas]. Yo they probably did. I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this. Your highness, Q-Boro's finest. Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas. Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard. To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up. Feeling like you down on your luck. Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library. Appeal the game, all eyes on me. Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized. We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad. Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style. No heart and no look, shook. Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight. Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue. We too official, blue steel pistols. Teflon vests, it's no contest we hit you. Forty-First side. Yeah youknahmsayin. Not for nothing baby. Knahmsayin wanna give a shout out to my peoples. YouknowhatImean, Yambo, Ill Will. Killa Black, my brother.

My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering. \"Put your gun down, we can skip town\". Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat.

Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies. An' a flag on a moon. And can't find food for the starving tummies. Pay no mind to the youths. Cause it's not like the future depends on it. But save the animals in the zoo. Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money. This is how the media pillages. On the TV the picture is. Savages in villages. And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids. Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids. Stereotyping the image of the images. And this is what the image is. You buy a khaki pants. And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones. An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones. Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known. Put the worst on display so the world can see. And that's all they will ever show. So the ones in the West. Will never move East. And feel like they could be at home. Dem get tricked by the beast. But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?. Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone. My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord. Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience.. That's what the old folks told me. Discovering the World before this World.. A World buried in time. Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer. Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?. We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?. Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?. Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?. The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off. Now the Earth is round. If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh. The average man can't prove of most of the things. That he chooses to speak of. And still won't research and find out. The root of the truth that you seek of. Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning. Tell them find a cure when we sneeze. And that's when their nose start running. And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut. Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud. Can you read signs? can you read stars?. Can you make peace? can you fight war?. Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh. Can you survive? Against all odds, now?. It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react. You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant. You're scared of the truth, be patient for now. Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?. And was it a lightning storm. That gave birth to the Earth. And then dinosaurs were born? damn. Who made up words? Who made up numbers?. And what kind of spell is mankind under?. Everything on the planet we preserve and can it. Microwaved it and try it. No matter what we'll survive it. What's hue? What's man? What's human?. Anything along the land we consuming. Eatin', deletin', ruin. Trying to get paper. Gotta have land, gotta have acres. So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson. Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers. In a world full of 52. fakers. Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers. You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders. Make a wish for the day cuz. Like somebody got a doll of me. Stickin' needles in my arteries. But I can't feel it. Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'. I'm fearless.... I'm fearless. Don't you try and grab hold of my soul. It's like a military soldier since seven years old. I held real dead bodies in my arms. Felt their body turn cold, oh. Why we born in the first place. If this is how we gotta go?. Damn. This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World.

I've been recorded saying that. He's definitely the best player in our league. Um, to me, in my eyes. The best scorer in our league. And there's not another guy in our league. That can accomplish some of the things. That he's doing. Never take a day off. Catch you at the top of the key. And get a J off. Baseline face time. Tongue out like two-three. Even two-three gotta love how I do me. Practice while you sleep. Practice in my sleep. Straight outta high school. Tha brackets ain't for me. I will be jumpin' over you. Like I got a mattress at my feet. And all the Phil Jackson say teams. Better be passin' it to me. I put the master in the piece. Attack you like a beast. I am starvin' for victory. And that means I'mma eat. And when they ask you who's the best. Then the answer should be me. Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic. I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley. I'm going for the ring. I'm going for the ring. I went to Beijing. And came back with the bling. Who they want. They want Kobe. And what he want. He want the trophy. The victory. And the glory. No Shaq. No Robert Horry. Or he properly dishing it to Gasol. Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah. Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah. Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah. Do it for Magic. It's your time baby. I see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby. I'm the best yes. And he the best yeah. Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year. Now what's defense. To an assassin. Killer instinct. Murder the basket. Then steal the ball back. It's more than a game. Been a all-star, been a champion. Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting. MVP. Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me. In knee deep, smash any D. Whoever he is he can't guard me. He can't guard me. \"},\n",

Ain\\'t shit changed,. except the number after the dot. On the Range,. way niggas look at me now, kinda strange. I hate y\\'all too. Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachel. It\\'s unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal. Bitches used to go, \"Ewww!\". Still tote steel, I\\'m trying to see five mil. Off the single, for real. You ain\\'t fazing the amazing. While your gun\\'s raising, mine is blazing. Blocka, Roc-a-Fella, Bad Boy collabo. Two MCs with mad dough, you know. [Verse 3- Jay-Z]. Miraculous, pockets stay full. Niggas skip the bull cause we matadors. Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers. And we clap the doors of your Acuras. Snap like cameras on amateurs. Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours. Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws. Everybody got a part to play, back to yours. Run up in your crib now, crack your doors. Watch the real players live, it\\'s a habit to floss. Play the charts like The Beatles,. And toast Cristal on behalf of y\\'all. Too bad for y\\'all. Ain\\'t too many as bad as yours truly. Do we, we laugh at y\\'all. Little bastards y\\'all. We hit makers with acres. Roll shakers in Vegas, you can\\'t break us. Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq. Who say mobsters don\\'t prosper. Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars. Me I\\'m critically acclaimed, slug passed your brain. Reminisce on dames whose coochie used to stink. When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links. Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places. Tito smile every time he see our faces. Cases catch more than outfielders. Couldn\\'t score if they had point game, they lame. Speak my name, I make \\'em dash like Dame. '},\n",

Uhh, no time to sleep cuz if you sleep you don't eat. Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet. Niggas living on the street while other niggas feast. Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me. Gotta stay fucking bitches many types. They know me so they restructure and reroute. All the way to London to my nigga Common house, right. Get your third eye poked. Fuck game, I assemble dope. Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test. Your B I, feel it in her breasts. Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced. Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style. Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know, nann nigga. You better goin to God like Mase did. Leaving crowds complacent. I move 'em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit. Or thug style you can feel it in your body. Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body. Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body. You don't want it, need to find your ass a hobby. I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did. I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkist. You want this, see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless. Shit fly like MJ in his prime, Off The Wall with mines. Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex. You ain't on my mind I'm thinking bout paychecks. Connant Gardens. they bust like latex sex packets. Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all. They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time. We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines. Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports. We gettin money a long time and y'all short. My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall. When you roll a 500 that's really a 320. Should of let somebody else hook it. Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it. I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate. That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday. Show you the definition of a payback. \"},\n",

Some sheisty New York niggas, thirsty for cheddar. You shining, you get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater. Keeping these rap fans like crack fiends. Until we re-up, and put more infamous up on the rap scene. Mix the coke rhymes in pieces like baking soda. Albums is G-Packs selling across foreign waters. My Mobb picks is like dime bricks. Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top kid. And once we all on top ain't no stopping it. I'm headstrong. at peace with myself like Islam. You stupid, a hundred niggas form around me. Like forcefield pull out a used gun like shield. The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill. Beware, of quiet niggas laying in the cut (for what?). Patiently watching waiting for a come up. Get your spot took, we rob land like white man. Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shaking your hand. Up the ladder of success. with Tecs we build and destroy. Still shining, still climbing. Nine six to the motherfucking year two G. The Mobb got it locked with the master keys. Word life combination to the safe it's on. The 41st. heat. Yes divine nine. Regulate, I'm only here just to take what's mine. A half a man generating grands. Kid you know how I go, only fuck with fam. That's why you're looking from the outside in. Wondering how we bubbling. Grimy motherfuckers, getting info from your baby's mother. Got her pillow talking while that ass is sleepwalking. So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live. Your broke ass probably don't got a vest. So I suggest change your location is best. Because I'm coming through army fatigue dressed. Blessed with hollow tips yes, to burn through your dirty ass Guess. A-yo your timing was way the fuck off, what is you trying?. This faggot ass cat should get clapped for even trying. He tried to confront me, but only faced iron. Put holes through your shirt like Jamaican clothes. Fuck the myths, but science in numbers is how I live. If we ain't getting mathematics something got to give. Broke all your fucking life with nowhere to live. There's no way to live, resort to Plan B. Start to sticking.  strong arm robbery and ice picking. It's sneak vicking. it's cold outside. I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines. You follow what I'm saying it's like leading the blind. Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime. You slow learners'll understand in due time. Up the ladder of success with Tecs we trying to eat. And put that fly shit on my back. And bless my feet with some new and improved. spectate or make a move. Hesitate or regulate it's on you. \"},\n",
