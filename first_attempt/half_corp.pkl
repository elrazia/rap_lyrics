S'If she ain\'t in by six, she\'ll catch another pink slip. And that\'s three and that means fired. The coffee thermos in the purse to help her keep wired. The day-care where she drops the baby off. Thank god it\'s on the same block as the bus stop. By 5:30, she\'s halfway there. And her back already hurts from the bus\' plastic chair. Live to work to live to work to live. Gotta feed the kid and give it all she\'s got to give. Plus she tryna catch a little overtime. If she stays till four she could be home by five. Shuts her eyes for the rest of the route. And keeps her headphones loud to drown everything out. But the same old song.... "Whoa... whoa, not another day!". Not another day of the same old song. "Whoa... whoa, not another day!". Not another day of the same old song. [Verse 2]. Seemed like nobody even knew his name, huh. If he disappeared would they even see the blank spot?. The only kids who might notice are the ones who. Push him up and down the hallways and in the lunchrooms. Sometimes he looks at his bruises and wants to come to school with. A gun like them kids on the news did. But nah man they don\'t deserve to die. He\'s the type that couldn\'t even murder a fly. I guess you get used to the life. Maybe that\'s why he refuses to cry. Takes it on the chin, takes it in stride. What doesn\'t break you just makes you stronger right?. So he sits by himself on the school bus. Hoping that today he wouldn\'t have to put his dupes up. But just like any other, here they come. To fuck with his comfort,. can\'t wait for summer. It\'s the same old song.... Verse 3. C\'mon, woke up at the taste of dawn. When the city\'s bloodline starts to push it along. The generators on those public buses. Is enough to bust you out of any dream that you stuck in. I guess that\'s the chance you taking. When you camp out in front of that transfer station. And this town got no answers to chase. That\'s why he always sleeps near the transportation. Panhandle it, transient freedom. Transplant, he ain\'t from this region. And when the wind starts to whisper its lips. He knows enough to pack it up and dip out before the winter hits. Childhood dreams washed down the gutter. Both parents gone, no sisters, no brothers. Weak memories, strong paranoia. While the same song repeats in his head. Over and over and over and over it goes.... '

But I'm forced to play solitaire 'till I get up out of here. Move like a wanted man with a bounty on his head. Work alone, sleep alone, eat alone, daily bread. Walking in the shoes of a man with a broken leg. Flame on the trail headed for the powder keg. Last place in the race I ain't never led. Serving in the army of one, it's on again. Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk it alone. I always been on my own, ever since the day I born. So I don't mind walking alone. I'm in a chess match,. I'm one blood when the sky turns jet black. No love in the world can correct that. I'm on my Cobain. I'm in the new spot tryna run a old game. I got a new chick, put out my old flame. no love for a young beast. You can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed. There ain't no hell like the hell I raise. I'd die in the bed I made 'fore I lay with a love I loathe. I'm a snake in the garden of bones. I'm a loner in a world of clones. I'm the piece that don't belong, see I roam. Where the Reaper roam 'till they put my name on a stone. The longest walk I'll probably ever be on. The Road to Perdition, guess I'm fin' to get my plea on. I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on. I promise every second felt as if it took an eon. Walking like the lost boys of Sierra Leone. The trail of tears what they got me like a Cherokee on. Between the ears something I require therapy on. For working to the bone like my name Robert Guillaume. I go above and beyond, the duty called. Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call. Ask me if I'm just another mouli or a movie star. Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard. Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on. A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home.

Cause see, the past tense, it never really passes. Phases that trap us and cage us like classes. Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess. Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status. Passing bucks like a casual blunt. Granted, hustling habits on the stump of a mansion. While bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks. Bad shit going down on the daily. While bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn. They see he's the bastard for chasing them. Maybe, it's the patterns that make me that made me...crazy. Life is fiction, competition and contradiction. Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection. Love is a lotto, I know I know you know what I know. Hope is so hollow, that's why winos follow the bottle. And people pressure, make death a hidden treasure. A guilty pleasure, lonely language inside a letter. It's now or never, move it, move it, love it or lose it. 'Fore it's recruited, then included in something stupid. It's things of nature, paid a player and say your prayers. Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars. You 'bout it, 'bout it, don't allow it to pow without it. Then those who doubt it, doomed to die the death of cowards. The world is yours, and the world we can't afford. So ignore the law; start a fire, then start a war. If you're sick and tired of your access denied. Free will died long before blogs and iPod. Yo, it's too much strain for nominal gain. I'm going through things; headaches, abdominal pain. Tryna numb it with that kettle like I'm from the Ukraine. Check the blue flame, lighter running out of butane. What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive. Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with. Contaminating family and close friends. Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends. Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens. Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in. The darker the covenant-slash-trainwreck for you to rubberneck. Hit me up at black.gov like the government. Banana Republican. , alien intelligence. The stone the builder refused, he need to build with. Got immunized for both flus, I'm still sick. "

She like light sun in the morning makes. Not son of the morning. More like daughter of dawn. The queen of the summer. None hotter has spawned. She's killin' the game. When I?m feelin' her flame. It kills stress so the villain remains. [Hook]. [Verse 2: Eligh]. She's always had it, blue flame magic inside her basket. The ability to move through pain like you move through traffic. Born that way, like a brick house. Tough and hard to interpret, kept her feelings un-detected. Reflective on the surface. Eartha Kitt with the spit, she could get anything with the wit. She gamed up, she came up off the cats that want to fuck. On they back they lay, ate like a parfait, no bar code. She's off the grid, orphan to the streets. Morphing enemies into puzzle pieces, put them in they place. Inner space filled with pills dissolving in a Hennessy lake. Of sadness, a woman's madness, on the brink of a break down. She finds surrender, and though that may sound like giving in. She found her way back to self, and from the days that. She pimped those hoes across the race track. She found some peace in knowing that's she's decent in the. Eyes of god. and she can teach that, a reach back, to the. Young girls, on the avenues, with the same flame. Tattooed on their corneas. [Hook]. [Verse 3: The Grouch]. It's burning. I felt it. Inferno. Melted. Speechless. Moments. Vibrations. Opponents. She's so hot. And steaming. All words. Are unheard. I sure got. The meaning. No wonder. Just thunder. Much like sun rays at noontime. Or alcohol content in moonshine. Scorching the area of focus. Make ashes of your entire fortress. With one look. It's over. Game done. A soldier. Passion. Desire. Inside her. The fire!. [Hook]. "

Manslaughter, eight degrees of separation. Leave your body chopped up in a piece, that's mutilation. [Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]. Six million ways to die,. cyanide in your drink. Catch a Cuban necktie for your mink. Dahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge. And maybe washed up ashore and found under the bridge. Hit him with the whip, drag him half a block. Machete. or the sock full of padlocks. Chainsaw, switch your medication. Stomp a nigga out til he one with the pavement. Suspicions of him being a rat? Even worse than cheating. I'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists. Brassknuckle. steel toe kicks. Cracked ribs, punctured lungs, hard breathing. He's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch. He clinches the shirt on his chest. In a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed. First things first, I chop your head to your fingertips. Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments. Make sure it's legitimate,. conceal all my fingerprints. A hole in the desert, body bag, just polluted it. Your miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch. Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up. Delete your fucking history broke bone, missing teeth. my luck is a Mr. Clean. Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene. Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team. It's sinister to finish it,. hit with the man with no face. [Verse 6: Masta Killa]. Red wine and pink veal. Unknowing that this would be his last meal. Comfortable he?s made to feel. Kept his refills filled. Titties like big ass, kept him still for the real deal. Tommy gun specialist. Our one accomplice, sipped Courvoisier at the bar. Then waited till she lit a cigar. Then sprayed. In shattered wine glass he lay, he never saw it coming. Yo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh. Blow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years. You got no heart,. I'll hunt you down like Cape Fear. Push your brains out the back of your head. Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trashcan. Ghost carved through your skin tissue til the bone grizzle. "

People gotta go out there and bust they, bust they ass for a job. I mean, my dad's got five kids, man and I mean yo. He hates drivin' a bus but he loves five kids. I'm a rhyme artist. Out here tryin' to grind my hardest. Up early so to milk the cow. Keep my john deere out here plowin' the fields. To keep my john hancock's worth up in the now. Went from hangin' on blocks to hangin' on charts. Positions is parta my mission to hangin' on top. Gotta get your polly cracker or with them crackers. And them scheisty ass niggas if you like it or not. I've been rewired to work more efficiently in the dirt. I'm hands on with it all up in my cuticles. Some try to get off the farm but fell into harm. Of gettin in the game of those street pharmaceuticals. But, I was raised in those blue collar themes. Havin' white collar dreams cause I see what it means. And though the meek shall inherit the earth but don't forget. The poor are the ones who inherit the debt. You can bet I got better things to do than that. I was a dick who got jerked by Tom and his boys. Came on my land, seized my cattle, and catalog. As if it wouldn't leave me less than coy. But I'm far from bitter even farther from quittin'. Got a grind date to make, no time for sittin'. And playin' xbox, stand up and exercise my rights. As of by seen of through masta's eye. Know what I'm sayin? I'm sick of askin' that. I'm gonna milk the cow and cook the meat. The grind date. At least I'm gonna have some kind of food and drink. Like momma said that if you need 5 cents don't ask for 3. Ask for 10, that's for sure. Yo fuck a rhyme artist, I ain't here for that. My hands on experience was hands on my first contract. Taught me quick how to respect the game. Introduced to the block, got used to the block. But your neighbors be the ones who throw shit on your lawn. It's like every single time we pop, they got annoyed. But we got ahead, and we got along. And puttin' work on the calendars, worse on them calendars. Worth of hump days that broke the camel's back. The grind'll make today look gray. And paint a tainted picture of tomorrows in enamel black. And show you why we here this long. Cause when it comes to puttin' in work. Once again it's on. I'm just like everybody else man. An average nigga with above average potential. You know what I mean? I'm not sayin' that I'm a gentleman. I'm sayin that I know how to act like a gentleman. In order to get the things that I need. This ain't no accident, we stayin' here. I don't want you to get the wrong, yo baby on the real?. I don't have sex with people that I do business with neither.

A mean one. Good daddy won't smoke no weed. Until the Bass cradles her back to sleep. Then he can steak his Mack while she takes a nap. To the sweet pretty sounds of the gansta rap. The high hat to angels voices. They keep her distracted from the stranger's voices. Escape is a paradox, because a childhood is locked in that music box. Daddies drive around, Mommies work night shift. Sweet dreams, sleep little precious. Lay down in that music box. Escape in the sound of that music box. The guy with the suit and tie they see at the court. And it seems like he ain't tryin to talk to police. But at the car wash they treat him like the star that she sees. They like poppa's big wheels. Go ahead baby girl, don't spill those fries. Nuh uh poppa can't roll a messy office. She knows all the words, but she leave out the bad ones. Except bitch-she always sings the word bitch. Cause it makes her daddy laugh, it's her magic trick. And when daddy picks mommy up, they fight. They fight about money, they fight about life. So she concentrates so so hard on the music. And loses herself inside of the bass and the movement. "

I take care of my dimes. But I excluded I had nickels. Addin\' up to her kind. Sayin she didn\'t need a man. To make her out for a fool. And if you need that extra help. Then she broke out with the words. About knowin all the rumors. "See, all you niggas rappin be like pedigree dogs. Thinkin you can have me leashed. Around your microphone cords". Somethin \'bout her lit me up like july. And with them onions in the pants. I couldn\'t help but cry. Seemed lost in the essence. But i had to find my way to take. Action for the digits just to set up a date. Thought my shinin was on. I had the skirts in the bag. Until i took a bit of time. To peep the price on the tag. salt and pepa. sisters. [Listen all you fellas, here\'s what good love is]. [Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands]. [Listen all you fellas, then you won\'t have to worry no no more]. [Listen all you fellas, you betta listen] [you betta listen]. We was at some outside jam one saturday night. When this pretty ass girl got locked in my sight. She was a ghetto philosopher. Yeah you know the type. Thinkin\' Mary J. and sade understood her strife. Caught me lookin\', "Yo what\'s cookin?". "Nothin\' from around here. So don\'t approach or hope. To be the man of the year". I said listen deer or rabbit or whatever the hell you be. I\'m not the one to embarrass. But the one to emcee. I traveled the world q uarters on my relationships. Used and abused by hoes. So my royalty stubs. But above all. I brought my daughter into this earth. So I understand the need. Of women feeling of worth. She glanced deep in my eyes. And said "oh shit, you\'re ill. I like the way your mind. Moves around at will. Still, let me apologize for soundin so sassy. But you niggas act as if my ass. Has a sign that says harass me". Her name was gail from the union of dale. I made her remove the shades. So her eyes could tell me the plan. Yo where\'s your man?. "Oh that nigga\'s past tense. Painted bruises on my face. Haven\'t seen him ever since". Gave a pinch to my bottom. And started rubbing my back. She said "i bet your ass is darker. Than a mobb deep track". Only one way to know it. And i was down to show it. So we jetted back to my crib to set it. She made it known. "I\'ve owned thoughts of you. Since that song \'meeny-meeny\'. Can\'t believe you\'re about. To be all up in between me". Man, the flag was lowered. So my wood was raised. Followed a shielding of my building. To protect me from the blaze. This granted access to. Southern parts of her borders. Did you have her comin\'?. Like the new world order. I caught her with the right combination. A good combination. Keepin\' it in her hard, man. You betta listen. '

S"That's when I noticed your foot prints. The snow's fresh and those have been put since. What, you're already up making the rounds?. So where you at now, you laid back down?. The breeze came and it stalled out the flame. While I went to your tent and called out your name. You didn't answer, so I opened up the flap. It's just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack. I'm looking at your tracks and You took a couple laps. Around the campground. and hoofed down the path. I figure you'll return, no concern. I'mma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn. The wind is blowing strong, minutes rolling on. It's going on at least a half an hour you've been gone. It ain't right, start the paranoia. I left the camp site to go and search for ya. I read the trail your feet made. Each step was deliberately placed. It looks like you know where it leads. But I see nothing but leafless frozen trees. About a quarter mile into the course. Another set of tracks appeared next to yours. From the north it came out of the thick woods. And those footprints belong to a big wolf. Trying to find service on my cellphone. I felt aight with my knife on my belt, though. I hope the wolf is intimidated by you. I wondered if you even knew what was behind you. Stalking ya, maybe watching ya. Waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya. Salivating', wanna take ya to the stomach. In the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick. And it gets about as bad it goes. Cause I notice there's a new set of tracks in the snow. I understood, it doesn't look good. Your fan club doubled, now you've got another wolf. And the odds are in favor of the home team. Why'd you walk off all alone, where you going?. It ain't the right time to complain, but. It feels like I'm trying to find your remains. Your foot prints grew further apart. I knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart. It means you started to run, so I did the same. Now my breaths looking like a steam engine train. Suddenly your tracks dip off of the path. And so did theirs, so my knife I grabbed. Into the forest, expect the worst. Adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves. 50 yards into the woods and brush. It got so thick that it looked like dusk. The air stood serene, sober. It seemed like a good 15 degrees colder. And I'll admit: Hell yeah, I felt fear. The sound of my heart beat was all I could hear. Looking at the snow it was plain and clear. There was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared. I can't process, I don't follow. It would be easier to believe that you were swallowed. With no sign of death, no sign of struggle. No signs of blood, no signs of trouble. And the wolves never stopped. The tracks kept going and I took off. So I don't know how your story ends. But I know I'll never go into those woods again. It's not that tragic, it's not a shame. You're not the hunted, you're not the aim. You just another dog with hunger pains. I was so afraid that you'd become the game. . I forgot to worry about what you became. You're not the hunted, you're not the aim. You just another dog with hunger pains. I was so afraid that you'd become the game. "

Last thing I remember was the Ogden Theatre. The Zodiac Killer\'s \'bout to rock this. At the Great American Music Hall, pissin\' on the box office. All around the world, same Sean. Houston and Ludlow,. No prob, I\'ll play the part of doorknob and make it look. So good you\'re gonna wish that it was your job. It\'s all about the hangovers, and late checkouts.

Without no clearance, I nurture this track like I'm its parents. Your whole roster couldn't take on that one Sun of Man. Get your street team, get your stickers out, put your posters up. Boost your budget up, still Razah gonna fuck it up. Verse 2: GZA. Industrialized niggas change as soon as you get in. Throw 'em on an auction block, CEOs bidding. Highest price paid for those wack rhymes made. Was overrated, cut off, never reinstated. Feed you hungry MCs who be starving as hell. I laid the first verse to quench a dry ass nigga's thirst. Who drank my wisdom up like water till his stomach burst. Full tank with the premium quality raps. Mickey Mouse niggas get caught on a trap. You Cottonelle kid from Tottenville, you're Kleenex. Niggas get tossed and turned in this and burnt again. Scorched at a thousand degrees from live MCs. I melt y'all niggas down to the size of fleas. We cruise across the Brooklyn Bridge doing 60. Illegal driving from dusk till red dawn. Yeah you, you know your Power-U. You recognize the voice, it's the nigga from the Wu. Every dart I spit gets mastered and promoted. cause you're sweet and sugar coated. your style is half stale half moulded, moulded. "

S"The first shall be last and the last shall be first. The basic instructions before leaving earth. Knowledge is wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve. I loved doing right but I was trapped in Hell. I searched for the truth since my youth. And went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot. That I was paying plus the praying. I didn't like staying cause of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties. That the preacher had souped up with lies. Had me cooped up looking at loot, butt and thighs. During the service he swallowed up the poor. And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor. and explored my history that was untold. And dropped a jewel like Solomon. but never followed men. Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than. Space oblivia or the abyss. With no trace of trivia left with the hiss. Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?. From a slave we was kept from the mind. And from the caves he crept from behind. And what he gave was the sect of the swine. When the Bible, it condemned the pig. I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs. But we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban. No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie. I speak on Jacob. And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme. I did it anyway just to wake up the mind. Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet. For years religion did nothing but divide. I strolled through the books of Job. And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals. Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah. When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya. See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend. Why should you die to go to heaven?. The Earth is already in space,. I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when. I found out that we were the chosen. I deal with the truth, and build with the youth. And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop. And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs. To legalize abortion. the evil eye distortion. I quiz Son with my wisdom. Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted. The study of wisdom, I preferred it. The understanding, it gave me mental freedom. I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam. The white image of Christ is really Cesare Borgia. And uhh, the second son of. Pope Alexander. The Sixth of Rome. and once the picture was shown. That's how the devils tricked my dome. I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn. For my nation - the seed of Abraham. So study and be wise in these days of darkness. Peace to my nephew Marcus. The basic instructions before leaving earth. "

The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions. In truth, he had a capital T terrible 2 days. That chewed his plumage to the root. And proved a prequel to malaise. A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face. He\'d been replaying the scenario for days. With the variables replaced. Meh. in the sky with more diamonds. the carpet from the Shining. Part riot, part Orion. We jarred a lot of lightning up. Shook a turkey leg or 10. Maybe we deserve a day of rest. Not to mention.... I said, "I\'ll take first watch". 1 AM defend the whole block. The coyotes, summon the ghosts of blown diodes. Open to moving like a luchador with no eyeholes. Fried while the pipes froze, life goes Lovecraft. Christ-pose, sitting on invisible hubcaps, up. Call Alex back, daggers in the basil patch. Tell him maybe less badminton more Scrabble Dash. Less Jarts more Rummikub, whatever. Keep the scallywag wrapped up in the subterfuge. Pay the piper COD. Aware the pot and kettle shop, a little toxin equally, at least. Either way a vital widget in the system is sick. A sea of symptoms in the hinges, hit the room all at once. All I can do is plug the roof with my gum. Tell him, "Maybe less freeze tag, more hack-n-slash". So a third party, who is incidentally not Alex. Seen a black bear catawampus by the college campus. Soon the safety propaganda clamps breeds on leashes. No compost, bird seed out of feeders. Make a lot of noise when you frolic under the ether. Keep a hand on the pepper spray. Sneakers on the detour. They\'re more scared of you than you them. Although, one of us chews limbs, and one has 2 chins. Guilty in the window romanticizing the potters field. Found money in the speaker. bought lower Manhattan pizza. You meet a few exceedingly forsaken. Sit around the cooler refusing domestication. Then a couple decades pass. Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots. '

Here to make you happy. 'Hey daddy tell me why the clown is crying.'. 'Well son he's got the task of cheering up the ill and dying. On top of that everybody thinks that he's insane. Can't fathom why he'd wanna ease their pain.'. Walking through this maze made of concrete walls. When you're not allowed to climb there's no way to possibly. Fall. When your hands are restricted to hold nothing but self. How can you get a grip?. How can you pick up what you're dealt?. The clown stays sad. The ground stays hard. With a couple pounds of migraine, a pocket full of scars. But the face stays painted on for everyone to gaze upon. Continuing the bad dream till he wakes up gone. two voices intertwined. Do they see me?. Do they know that I exist?. I know they do. I can tell by the way they wave their fists. My purpose on this earth was to brighten the sun ray. At the circus or parade, house call on a birthday. A bag of balloons, I can build you a farm. Became worthless when they took away both of my arms. I wanted to turn every frown upside down. Some how my feet separated from the ground. And the clown stays sad the people stay lost. Nah, the people are sad, we lost the clown. "

Expectin\' nuttin but a little bit of radio play. Gettin diced on 1 and 2\'s by the best DJs, hey. And some expected me to start buhlooning in the mind. Seein\' spaces and places that I couldn\'t pronounce. A mother gets mugged by her crackhead son. "That\'s the brakes, that\'s the brakes". You\'re in the wrong part of town so the shots make you run. "That\'s the brakes, that\'s the brakes". Your best comrades put six tabs in your o.e. See, money don\'t make shots repel. I break woes and compose some rhymes to tell.

I sunk to find the warmth. beneath the mosses. With a plan to tunnel past after the rains have run their courses. But alas, the portraits of these frostbit corpses tortured in the grass. Offered this torch supporter one tall glass and nauseous. And I'm asking you: Why's the spy supply hiding in strangers. When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres?. Now be gracious, these minstrels turn a bully cycle civil. By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels. The upbringing of self-styled freedom brigade investors. And their studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors. Puts it down. It's down beneath your sappy sing-a-longs. Let's take it further down, we'll let Dante decide which ring I'm on. Nova. The elders took positions and the fans marched. Parched, plain and steamed. Hawking the rain in my canteen. Now I'm like point:. I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads. Counterpoint:. During my famine I never got broke your bread. Well, equation of intrigue, yes, yes. Lemme fence sit for a bit. These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens. Shut the fuck up. Drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt. Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth. It hurts. Must not sleep. Must warn others. Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers. I milk my habitat for almost everything I want. Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut. Must not sleep. Must warn others. I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine. But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning. Crowning the glory of our advance. Fire ants to water beetles. These Freemasons adjacent to pacing pins and needles. Pupil turned pedagogue,. benediction to my dream. Beaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine. I'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time. Gripping the stem in the right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline. It's a metaphor for nighttime. Anti-up the slight cost of exhaustion. paradise lost. stringent. Inch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul. Burrow up through the dirt with bloody digit. Lick my knuckles clean. Noting the corporate clusters holding hands. 'round the abode of the damned. Now what's your poison?. Starlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser. Sip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later:. The eyelids pivot back upon the hinges. 20 miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passers by. Now I'm 6 foot 4 with a 6-floor walk up just to recline. With no free time. The alarm storms at nine. My daytime's on some, 'Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Right away sir. Sir, do you mind if I breathe, sir?. Oh you do? Well excuse me, sir, fuck you.'. I breathe slow. I run in with these fantastic amalgams. Painting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with classic albums. catch it. Clocked in in '76 and haven't clocked out ever since. "

Then they gave us crack and beer. (Your arms too short to box with god...). Devil\'s marvelled, they caught us playing with the gold marbles. We wrote novels, now we live life in the bottle. Before the devil sold me to the unholy. He called my father Toby. I live life amongst the lowly. The president just ordered the navy to hit the borders of Haiti. Slaughtered babies from the waters of Euphrates. Maybe they sent germs that polluted our sperm. And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent eyes. And told us certain lies and each day a servant dies. But in the halls of Pharaoh the walls are narrow. And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom.

S"200 horse-power under the hood. Junk in the trunk very far from damaged goods. Designer frames with windshields that stay tinted. The most beautiful thing someone invented. Her wrangler. had a sticker on the bumper. Rear view mirror that of Serena William. Staring was a crime then the look, kill 'em. Brushless showers and the Brazilian wax. Cash in the glove compartment free from tax. Low mileage on the odometer. Graduate with more degrees than a thermometer. Spark plugs for great conversation. She would focus on the finish line and destination. Steering in the right direction. Made sure I wore seat belts had air bags for protection. In her tank she loved to stash my tool. I kept her full, super-unleaded fuel. She had a room full of skirts and rims. The old ones used to swing off ropes that often hung from limbs. Ford modeling agency. Suburban. area where the Caucasians be. Cherokee. Explorer. navigator. Sharpening his arrows on Plymouth Rock. Commander-in-chief who raise cattle on the selling of livestock. King of the frontier, rider of thoroughbreds. He was just as sharp as a needle without thread. Legend in truth but known to run the herd. His sons were. oldsmobiles. who drank thunderbird. Land cruisers. sitting on. fertile soil. With equipment that ran off expensive oil. Folks bragging said the horse pulled a Volkswagen. They love mustang. sally. and lollygagging. Fished in Lake. Tahoe. cooked the barracudas. Hunted impalas. with the six-shooters. From a long range with the dog. Rover. It was something else to see 'em knock them over. Some got caught in the crossfire. Bunch of rabbits. One was going bald rocking a sunroof. A gas guzzler. in his grill was one tooth. A strong accent,. and a beard like Lincoln. Who hated the golf course,. but he loved drinking. Avenger,. Had magnums.  that were ram tough but thick. He wore blazers. where he used to hide the Ruger. For encounters with the jaguars. and cougars. In accord with the plan. he was the phantom. He had a fat lady they called hummer. And umm, she needed body work the whole summer. She had a few friends who used to stay in a pound. Gold diggers who on the cream like Wells Fargo. In Vegas, they circle around the Monte Carlo. You know the snakes with the fangs and vipers. Met the Cavaliers. at the Outback steakhouse. Chicken cutlets supreme just for takeout. One of them was forced to live in Astoria. Cause at the auction,. they had crowned victoria. Since then her friends charged her battery. She kept a loud muffler, couldn't trust her. Police used to always pull over this duster. A pothead. who some called a firebird. So insecure he kept LOJACK on her. He would check her consoles for rubbers. On her cycle, he would often run red lights. His voiced echoed. as she dodged the convo. Some drove her crazy, she was just a loner. He had her leaking transmission fluids. Another total eclipse of the heart. Like the freezing weather that never gave her a start. Plus he had a sidekick in his garage. He was sentenced for running an escort service. His baby mother had wifed a BMW. She done everything to regain her liberty. Tried to be outty,. Moved to Aspen,. survived a avalanche. A different element,. The distance was like from Mercury. to Saturn. "

In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids. In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it to him. Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall. Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on. When he came home and told on Trevor. Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots. Throwing them shots, like 'nigga, you know me'.

The way she got down was far from privileged info. Break up to make up, wake up and smell the indo. Just from how she liked to show her belly button window. Couldn't tell him nothing, 5200, Atari, or Sega. Test tube L's with the lid, Garcia y Vega. His tongue is like a sword that's mighty like the pen. And you ain't seen nothing like The Mighty Quinn. Alrighty then!. Seal the deal with the shaking of a hand. Peoples catching feelings like it's Making of the Band. Villain have your fake man quaking in his Vans. When he do a jam, fans break-dancing in the stands. Chances are you'll lose the battle and the war. Trying to go to shore with just a paddle and an oar. Ooh shucks, you should have known them two schmucks. lame ducks. Off beaucoup bucks. Metal Fingers. Metal Fingers,. fix the beat with fire water. Justice League. I used to sew army patches on my favorite coat. Homeless Sally from Cali cursed, cats in the alley. I called DOOM he said meet him on Monsta Island. velour suits, styling. With Lady J holding hands with the Baroness. Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes don't got nothing on this. I got them Go Go Gadgets. So when the Cobra-la come through the floor. I'm putting snakes in baskets. We rob and do our thang,. he's like Stimey from Our Gang. Guitar twang. try me, and wha da da dang!. I don't think you want to know, even if you still do. And want me to, I'll tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. it's like a grilled cheese sandwich. Gotta bring the butter else the bread'll get damaged. Flip it, slice it, and give half to Vast Aire. If you ask nice and bring a glass, we'll share the last beer. After the Cold Vein and Doomsday, we don't need no pop. And all you see is red, black, and green. they killed Radio Raheem!.

And connect em like letters when they're in cursive. I prey on em, I spray on em. First nigga to violate I regulate without warning. So ask yourself a question: Can the Canibus rhyme?. Is a fuckin porcupine half swine?. My rhymes confuse niggas like somebody tryna gangbang. Wearin a blue shirt and red pants. Throwin up signs with their left hand, standin out on the corner at Wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband. God damn eggplants, niggas gettin me vexed man. Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sanf. And I can't seem to get away from it. I dreamt that I stabbed Leviathan through the stomach and ate from it.

The murder sprees, random killings. Ghostface Killah's back attacking villains, hanging from the ceilings. Godfather motives, gangsta mentality. Black superhero with the immortality. Forever, I be creeping in a black mist. Ill night vision with the militant tactics. I glide through the air like a swarm of bees. Shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas. Revenge is the spice of life, it's so sweet. Meat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips. DeLucas lose. Pair of cement shoes, tossed in the ocean. Popped until they brain ooze, I won't lose. Blood all on my apron, hog tie 'em up while they try escaping. Peeped the visual, tied 'em up individual. Took their clothes off, season 'em like sausage. Let the pits out to eat 'em, that's the remedy. Attack, kill, bite off their extremities. Blood bath splash my name on my wall. Call it piece delivery, leave a tip on the stall. With an arm, leg, a head. I'm coming for you all. It's the sure shot. Heart of a lion, king of the jungle. I'm a humble killer bee, you as soft as a bumble. I'm a menace, the black Clark Kent,. caped crusader. The face of a ghost, I disappear in the vapors. You could murder my flesh and bone, soul's invincible. Revenge my death, payback's the main principal. Protect ya neck when you move,. Starks, the gangsta nigga, I never lose battles. Pimp nigga, with a superhero logo on my chest. Big Gucci link, GFK on the crest. Icy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes. All black down, royalty purple and some ice chips. Two Glock 9's pointed at you in a hype flick. Now I'm alone in the room, and I just stare at the wall. Revenge my death but I'm going through withdrawals. My lost niggas, I miss them this new power and wisdom. Got me thinking I've made a whole lot of bad decisions. Got locals still to deal with, should I kill her?. Throw her fuckin' ass in a cage with a gorilla. I'm the God now, plus I'm a super rich nigga. Do more help than harm, either way you figure. Should I protect and serve or cock and aim destruction?. Let the enterprise take over the force of production. I'm bulletproof now, back from the dead, I'm invincible. "

It\'s levels to this fellow, hello, I resemble the cheat codes. Some shit good, some shit flop. Some love to see you blow, they don\'t want see you pop. Shit good, some shit nah. Some shit recycled like second timers in Tour de France. First you picked up, now you picked apart. You get too far \'til your core fans au revoir.

Now when a kid gets a helium balloon, he\'s holding that string and he\'s keeping this balloon from going anywhere. But he also wants to let it go. Gave you a contract, stay true through all that.

Tell the purist that laugh I don\'t reach out for daps. Cause "No Hands" triple platinum. Better writings for retail, why not see my detail?. Gettin\' box office spins,. only box I fit in is by thigh on a female. So they hatin\' me for that, sayin\' I just make women songs.

And show y\'all what\'s for me. So he wants to let it go and he wants to catch it. Eventually he loses it, he doesn\'t want to lose it. Why they give a fuck about the songs I write?. Movin\' forward with my life. Crucify me, man of Jesus Christ. Nah do no more favor. Cause \'nough of them are traitor. Them a real back-biter. Them a try take your glory and your energy. Buffalo soldier. Selassie tell them man a gangster. And mi no see no boy me \'fraid of. Them are try take your glory and your energy. Whatever, tell \'em it\'s whatever. Wanna see me good or never see me better?. Fuck \'em, can\'t say nothin\'. Cause the same hand heal you might cut you. Fuck \'em, you ain\'t sayin\' nothin\'.

S"The birth of an old slang, the death of a new speak. A permanent post-game is littered with bridge trolls. Skirting the copay,. divvy the death toll. Familiar rising, and furnacing cold piles. Wandering wild things,. obelisk phantoms. On linoleum or lava. Not pillar of the commune. a splinter off the pagan. Who vote off the elusiveness of truth and exultation. From the point of view of students labeled putrid little aphids. beautiful and cryogenic stasis. Sadists. Committed to a lowdown Sisyphus up-rock. And I still row boats outta bottles without abandon. To shrink into the sunset. bumping Pachelbel's Canon. In D motherfucker,. the author of the artistry. May or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy. Too geeked up to even keep it down. Too peaced out to even be around. Too beat up to even breathe it out. (Too freaked out to even leave your house). my Lazarus species. Gag at the news truck. Raggedy hounds tooth, zilch on a bus pass. Black lawn, backyard melting into Lovecraft. kings becoming runners, and runts becoming alphas. front-side Tony Alva. And live to see another sexy generation fizzle. Out,. keep rap homely. Bear claw slippers, over-sized Billy Joel tee. Fat-faced, potbelly, neckbeard, crow?s feet. Rat nest, gross teeth, pock marks, go team. I walk with Hawaii on a greenscreen behind me. So even the awkward pauses feel inviting. Standing at a landmark sleep drought keep out. "

S"To not reflect or project these feelings i?m harboring. To not give fuck bout who?s feelings I?m bothering. It?s startling. How hard it is swallowing truth. I?m dry heaving on the daily. Need to water my roots. I?m supposed to be the type of soldier God would recruit. But I lost my troops and it?s soo hard to regroup. Tryna cope. Losing hope out following smoke. When I approach. They looking through me as if I was a ghost. Cause I?m. Not in the present. I?m present. But not my essence. Don?t count these seconds, nigga. Count your blessings!. But time is money. If a brother ain?t countin? dollars. I?d be homeless in these mountain hollers. It?s hard. I?m at odds. Between earth and star. But for the moment put the purp in the ?gar. My nigga. And just.... Learn from my mistakes, raking up the leaves. Burn them in my place, ashes in the breeze. Smash em in your face, for re-hashing the past. Now you can taste the history, misery and peace. Yet peace is in the present, so I make a constant effort. To feel my feet against the street, the way we feel the beat. Rattle and roll, straddle the bass line like I straddle my goals. Tight.. With a whip in sight, with a wit thats like a thousand. Sarcastic talk show hosts, and a viscous right jab. To mic stands. which might land the riches I grab, in the. Right place: the heart chakra. The riches I speak of are not of a monetary operating. System, your lost, obnoxious, non-spirit driven operas are. Not my cup of tea.. My people fuck with me. Because I'm fucking free!. I live in the now. The futures un-known. cook my destiny without a recipe. Just me and god to see beyond. To the victor goes history. Cover up the the misery. Oppressed seek oppressor for what's meant to be a memory. Placed upon papyrus or witnessed with your iris. Degraded through the grapevine soured as the vine is. Placed up on the food chain. So slaves can buy a new chain. Them graves can get new a name. Searching for a new lane while waving at the the past. To be the wave of the future but the tides turning fast. Cops already purging in the streets without a mask. The stage is being set with only extras in the cast. The faint of heart can't grasp how the brave can simply laugh. The humor is the hubris to be first to carve the path. And gasp.... Makin' time out of nothin' but everything. Can't is just a word that we never sing. Let it be heard. I make noise from the silence of light. Sights from the science of sound. Profound thoughts. Let's walk, between the seconds they talk. I pay it no mind I know their reference is off. I get my messages straight from the heavens. And share em with my brethren in case they're late to the session. Can you relate to the question?. I can, just a man with a place for progression. Face it, bass hits for discussion. It's all the same shit. Spaceships get percussive. I turn clocks with my muscles. Move rocks with a chuckle. Just watch, no buckle. When time is a puzzle then trust this. Life isn't measured it just is. "

S"And even though he's home now, sound and safe. Surrounded by the faces that he place his faith. The images visit from the past he witnessed. Can't stay away from the memories. Sticks with each detail, embedded in stone. Like he chiseled those convictions into his bones. The progress stops and pauses, spits and sputters. Like the basement faucet. And it's obvious he's lost in his regrets. You can smell it on his breath. Ain't no colour paint gonna cover the stains. But now the alcohol is gonna mother the pain. Tuck it away, no complaints. Just laying on his back, in his backyard under the rain. Take tomorrow but doesn't no how though. For every swallow there's another to follow. He weaves his way throughout the story. Looking for a new missing piece or a door key. Spirits used to be for celebration. But now they just take him away from the hell that's waiting. Re-up until it's three sheets up. And pick a place for the skeletons to meet up. Ain't no colour paint gonna cover the stains. But if the oxygen escapes it'll smother the flames. No introduction, doesn't speak his own name. Gonna beat them demons at they own game. The sunset rides to the end slow. Same song echoing outside of the window. You can't grow if the skin don't fit you. Sometimes you gotta get low just to get through. No inspiration left to do your best when. Nobody hates you more than your reflection. Suffer the shame until it stuffs the drain. He's got two hands and a bucket of paint. Come on. "

[Aight, check it out, here we go, yo]. [Verse One: Kool G Rap]. I'm tryin hard to explore, I'm not sure. What all the racial war for. It's makin me more sore. I walk through a color blind corridor. Seekin, for peace in the people I'm meetin. Black white and Puerto Rican men are greetin each other. Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others. You can discover, kids fathers and mothers. A meltin pot, no one felt they got prejudice. Listen I could never assist someone diss this. A landscape, with a dark and a light handshake. Havin fun, without one bein a fake snake. So let's form a rainbow over the mountain. And let's drink from the same water fountain. Let's make our Earth Day a story of. People that walk through the same territories. Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed. I beleive, we all breathe the same seed. Unless it's diluted, for somethin to intrude it. Then I see your family tree was uprooted. So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu. The racial manual is the evil that men do. I was raised in a nation of Asian. Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian. Siberian's no better than Nigerian. I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in. I'm no villain so why would I be killin Indians. My nationality's reality. And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality. These are words of a wise man, wisdom. Take a taste and erase the racism. The ink is black, the page is white. Together we learn how to read and write. People are black, got people that's white. Let's stop racism, and, let's unite. [Yo yo Kane, why don't you do your part. And then let me do mine and then we get outta here. Go ahead, bet]. In the days of slavery. Some got to run away and many got done away. Inferiority is what some men say. But that shit played out with Kunta Kinte. Then again in the streets of New York. I think of Yusef Hawkins, and I see you'e still stalkin. And when I think of barriers like Bensonhurst. Huh, notice how I mentioned hearse. We got to better this world of prejudice. People, make peace, and learn to live equal. Cause I don't look at myself as a. Coon or a mooley that would have to say massa. You better believe that I'm an asiatic descendant. And I know what's been amended and intended. So let's fulfill and get real, and try to build. A united nation, eliminate segregation. I know there's different strokes for different folks. But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes. So don't hate me or try to underrate me. Cause I collect ends drive a Benz and live greatly. And we can all live together in harmony. Without thinkin what color is harmin me. If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm. To E-R-A-S-E the racism. To the black and the white. The red and the yellow. To all the nationalities. I'd like to say hello. And I hope they stop racism and it's comin from our hearts.

I force feed Richard Simmons a big ass bag of snickers. Challenge Christopher Reeves to a game of twister. Hate to be crass and I know it ain\'t right. Unplug an old lady\'s life support screaming "follow the light". Follow what\'s right? Hell naw, follow what\'s wrong!. Send Bill Clinton a gift, a new gravity bong. Go on Fanatic and tell the artist he\'s wack. Find us an anorexic and tell her she\'s fat. Be at the mall sucking on mannequin titties. Kidnap an Amish family and lock em inside a Circuit city. Tell a priest his nun secretly praise Satan. Switch a hypochondriac?s chart with an AIDS patient. Send Hillary the Bill and Lewinski scene in claymation.

S'Run a plot on the map in hyperspatia. From the Society for Scientific Exploration. Color is vibration, vibration is sound. Sound resonates through the mouth, check it out. What I say vibrates no less than 9 ways. South, South East, West, South West, East. North, North East, North West. And the black and white images fade to grey sound waves. Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze. With a bewildering array of lyrical display. The best of Bis orbitally rearranged monoatomic elements. With a deft intelligence. The highest professorship, my English etiquette. Compels me to not say it if I can\'t spell it bitch. My circularized third eye sees all. Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls. I read one-fourth of the Library of Alexandria. Before it was burnt to the floor. I wish I could\'ve learned more. About the shapes of the sacred geometry they used to draw. They were new millennium but Euclidean in form. Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old. Carved from Egyptian gold, moulded in Assyria. With processed Beryllium by the quintillion. They cooked on symmetrical stoves. With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal. And they barbecued birds to the bone. They burned incense in a Buckminster Fuller type dome. I talked to Mr. Fuller over the phone. And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome. Said he didn\'t want to do it alone. I told him I was busy writing poems but I\'ll think about going. The process was slow and the dough was low. But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow. Plus I never travelled that far from home. Cydonian. Neon green grass, statues made from translucent glass. I\'ll be crazy to pass. It sounds so laid back, it helps me relax. K-Pax. nautilus. I was told pharyngoamygdalitis did not exist. You have a modest case of scaphocephalous. I prescribe some neo-gothic antibiotics. Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith. Deadly as 10 droplets of Ricin toxin. From every angle the competition gets boxed in. Its Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine. Translate the English alphabet to the omega text. Life is now and death is next. Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell. Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale. These dark side tales might affect sales. I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales. Use the aphrodisiac to get a female. Called Ginger, tie her up and drink her ginger ale. Grand Marnier for me, scotch on the rocks for you. Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoo\'s. In the studio with James Lipton. All of a sudden the boos turned into applause. My jaw\'s stronger than the Caninde Macaw\'s. Can\'t even count the bars I\'ve expended so far. Don\'t want to rap no more, it\'s been so long. I wish the clock would hurry up and tick. I\'m out in the bush and the sticks humping a hundred clicks. Dr Scholls gave me a good fit. When I was really ill. Putting Planck energy in a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill. The side effects will make you pass out. Followed by skin rash, itching, diarrhoea, nausea and dry mouth. You want a time out? You better spit a rhyme out. Before the community of real MCs die out. College students say to me, "You ain\'t smart". Record label A&Rs say, "This ain\'t art". These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark. You gotta be as obsequious as the Disciples of Jesus. This is my Master Thesis. '

S'Then many men will feel my pain. I blame no one, I am the Shogun. I am the sun, moon, stars, and emotions. My gun weighs a ton, point it at the black glass. Blast, then I\'m out the rain. Let it loose, let it free, let it exist, then let it be. Let it go, when I\'m in a battle with myself I drop. The hammer so quick, like Geronimo. Scalping the dishonorable, ego. Sick like, H1-N1-measles. Midnight key strokes, typing out my defects. My assets, at least though, I\'m looking at my true face. Illegal entry, to therapists and outside entities. Centuries I\'ve been moving about this universe. Surfing across the Milky way in a filthy way. But I cleaned my act up like acne. back up. My Mack truck, fill up the trunk with taxing lessons. To maximize my presence on Earth for this track meet. Not a race but a marathon. Larger than life like a Mastodon. Broke, but can\'t see where the cast is on. Healing fast, and at last its on. My power is now at 8.5, can\'t wait till I get to 10. Can\'t break a man who\'s made of water, can you. Read my grin, can you read my grin?. I ask. Give me the knowledge and wisdom. To craft stronger words and live them. Eliminate all hate from my system. To spread only love\'s the mission. I get, "Remember who you are Mr. Corey. Do your part be your own category. Protection and abundance is with you. Be not afraid there\'s no end to this truth". Help us all to shine! I say. Spirit bodies outta mine, I pray. And then I call back the pieces of me. That I left in the deepest of seas. Not really work in mysterious ways. But rather search and there will be light. Spread it too and you will be change. Unified by the breath of life. '

Damn God, you\'re killin it. Should incorporate it, invest half a mil\' in it. Rap cats talk with no will in it. Soundin like they virtual. This joint\'ll hurt you, yo. Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed. (shhh shhh shh, shhhhh) They did a job. Took all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD\'s. Of shiny-suit rappers and flossin emcees. Who fail at takin it to rhyme degrees. Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes. You need to not get nappy with me. Or else we gon\' "relax your mind, let your conscious be free". Yo, where my Wall Street niggas, if ya up in the stands. To my women that\'ll throw they hands against they punk-ass man.

S"Hold the mic like a memory. There was a time when I couldn't find energy. The only person that was feelin' me was Mrs. Hennessy. It's like life was pinnin' me down. I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned. You ain't gonna be a rapper, you're not a factor. You just a Kentucky boy, get yourself a tractor. Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve. That's when the liquor and weed became a need. Self-esteem was lower than snorkel cities. Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel?s titties. Then as soon as I started getting some pride. My sister hydroplaned and died on I-65. In a family full of pride, house full of tears. Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers. Heart full of fears all jeers, no cheers. 'Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear. I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm. And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs. Can't grow fond of past memories. Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy. Offended by the mental imagery. And suggest livin' in poverty was really meant for me. Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies. Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me. I can't begin to see how to control the flash backs. Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at. Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur. When I don't perceive what I feel I deserve. Being slurred by those not livin' in my position. My thoughts tend to glisten, just like a pot to piss in. And when I thought I'd risen, life freezes the frame. So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain. I sit back and reflect, on the wild paths in my life. Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right. You know what blasphemy's like, cursing at God. Cause you ain't got shit it hurts and it's hard. Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble. Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle. Most of my life's a daze got me forever lighting haze. Tryna forget the times, where I barely ate twice a day. For, alone and helpless, so when I only felt the shame. Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter. Few friends even then, most homies is fake. Feel like a prisoner in my home, pencil my only escape. I went from the block with my fam, to college exams. But the pressures still there, dog I'm still scared. But I know it will all be right in the end. As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen. "

Fuck a donation, we started our own charities. We had to hustle, we ain't caking like Russell. Paper chasing. serving fiends, at the gate when they come through. This one's for all my Newport slingers,. If you need some tips on how to hustle, drop me a line. Growing up, I remember them days, slinging that beige. Pumping trays on the first of the month, niggas was paid. I learned the tricks of the trade, with the flip or the save. When you bag up, wear rubber gloves and clean off the blade. I used to watch my older brother carve stones at the table. In and out of buildings, lamping in halls with eight balls. Way before they had the cameras installed. That was 9-7, when Biggie Smalls gave us the script. The Ten Crack Commandments on how to manage your bricks. Shopping bags, popping tags, with the brand new in shit.

I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes. And she'll bring the cadavers set 'em free and let 'em feed. The deviltry penciled me in, but I slept thick through my alarm clock.

By the way if that diamond ring don't shine. That's cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment. I'll pedal my tricycle. F-5 logistics of a twister. Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker. If I botched the operation I apologize (Sorry). The err's rooted in carbon. I'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets. I'm fresh out of Gepetto's woodwork asylum. See the frame, wire-bound knuckles. Let a tug of the puppeteer steer my hustle. Now when a page becomes a squire, be engaged, clap your wings. When a noble's demoted hope it don't sucker-punch the colony. But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker. And fasten stinger pageant results to the public eye. Is it genuine enough to feel, baby felon?. Negotiate comradery or wilt. My dismal little little loom. Purged urgent with dirty dominion monitor boxes. Hovering inches 'bove pertinent urchin toxins. (Now) You ain't excused from table side. Till the dinner plate's spotless. Slurping' liquid happy citizen enhancer. I got this slicky sycamore handshake. That mimics stitch splinter entry. Thereby filtering citizens tin man prior to axe descending. Captain passive spring loaded serenity. I'm trying to give this city acupuncture. Shovin' one-way pins in subway systems. Standing up where I'm landing', now that a runway victim (Push, push). Nature's gone batty, spreading spore legitimate. Slice the bishop, sever the ties, splinter the kinship. See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it. Cause it spreads the jinx on a sleeping cynic. I'm quadruple six plus scruples. category mayhem stems. So one overlooked the scene including loopholes. When Christ studies the return ramifications. I'll burn the campus to impress him. Then rock like Medusa glances. Who ran the final mile before the blanks blown?. Home alone sipping beetle juice. Just to numb it, then shimmy the needles loose. I built a castle out of fifty-two cards. Plus jokers, wit, and image. Modern theory charges us while remaining harnessed to the vintage. I'm valid hypothesis honoring Occam's Razor. With a seam sewn via fatigued knuckle work (Labor). I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed. In case Tommy Turbulence located The Matrix then impedes. Whistle me a dirge, falcon boogie burst classic. Bastard repellant fell in haunted machines screened by similars. Got beckoned like a suicide king to the dagger surface. Due to one queen who lodged her faith inside a broken circus. Me and my stargazer from the woodwork serve the furnace. Omit the discoloring on the lung then stung the serpents. I cherish the Ferris wheel's revolutions. It's not because the ride enthralls. More simply to the fact that it still revolves. Nursed in a bracket of televis, plastics and saccharin (well). I oppose mass panic. Thoroughbred fantasy cadets pose with a latch key demeanor. Returning to find a home vacant with no similars to compare days with. So let's build!. "

S'Was a role model, like a CARDINAL to our peers. A PATRIOTIC tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons. A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a DOLPHIN. When I met her, she was in drama school and wore BENGALS. Drove a BRONCO, and she was far from star spangled. Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills. Raised buffalo\'s, cause she was behind them BILLS. Had a man who always roared like LION. A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying. Couldn\'t care, she was losing her hair, from depression. She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions. I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed. You\'re a "ten-i-see", you just need to TITAN your game. Her ancestors were CHIEFS, who ran with running deer. On the sail with the SEAHAWKS, who battled the BUCCANEERS. The REDSKIN garments, was suede coat liners. Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners. They were hard working warriors, we call over timers. Shot plenty arrows at COWBOYS and 49ERS. Her interesting background, but quite unusual. Great for a script, but out of bounds for a musical. She told me to call her, if I came to town. I started TEXAN her, soon as my plane had touchdown. Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars. She pulled up at arrivals, driving the JAGUAR. Her BROWN skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven. Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, . was a RAVEN. As we entered, I heard laughter. She walked into a large living room, I went after her. There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were VIKINGS. Militant as PANTHERS, they\'re resemblance was striking. Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter. Energized like phones that just came off the . CHARGER. I introduced myself to gain yardage. Cuz anything less then smooth, would\'ve been straight up garbage. The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager. Thought I rolled with robbers, STEELERS and panty RAIDERS. She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season. One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing. I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined. It would\'ve been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line. Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off. One removed the lip gloss, like she was bout to lick all. She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet. Dying for me to PACKER, as she stroked my helmet. And I was thinking these girls was SAINTS. But it was first and ten, and there was extra walls to paint. Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle. Buckin\' like a COLT, before I released them puddles. They spread EAGLES like wide receivers. As I RAM them in the endzone, and they became true believers. I be liking chess. Cuz chess is crazy, right there, that\'s the ultimate. It\'s like a great hobby right there, playing chess. The board, the pieces, the squares, the movement. You know, war, capturing, thinking, strategy. Planning, music, it\'s hip-hop, and sports. It\'s life, it\'s reality. '

Doesn't matter, either way they're all out to hurt me. (Why don't you give that girl shit a little bit of a break?). I do, twenty times a day - I call 'em cigarette breaks. Mama never told me all they wanted was a daddy. Baby I could look just like him, maybe even act exactly. How he did. Uninterested, out of touch with what your mama needs. Hard to get through to, hard to please. Hard at work avoiding the family, talking to his secretary's tits. Measure the distance of pleasure mixed with business trips. As usual eyes wander, unscrupulous minds ponder. Possible outcomes over time('s on our side). I don't punch clocks, I knock 'em out the box, Rick (knock 'em out, Rick). Then some jock until I start the moshpit. Ladies' night at CBGB's hitting on punk rock chicks. Like blaow, how you like me now?. Inscribe my digits in my steel toe so you don't have to write 'em down. Embed it in your head to help you remember, it might help. Slight swells on your back from the cracks of a spiked belt. Trendy poser, she ain't mad at me. That's why I keep digging (digging, digging, digging). "

Holdin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What\'s up?). Plus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep. Don\'t wanna see none of this evil I speak. This is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it\'s worth. Xzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this. Players, pimps, hoes, hustlers. Willies, thugs, ballers, busters. Gangstas, macks, everyday, all day. Shot callers, even high rollers keep it moving. What you see is what you get now. The kinda style make the whole world go wild. Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone. And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that\'s the real shit. You got more than you bargained for; hit the floor. I pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black. Take your breath like an asthma attack. like Flavor Flav, "You\'re blind to the facts". Mr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee. Guaranteed to bring the house down naturally. Niggas knowin No Limits like Master P. Makin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?). A whole different breed of MC; realize it\'s you against me. Catch a three-hundred and sixty degree. And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright. I feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red. Cause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread. Niggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead. Came crashin through the door like the Feds. Slug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt. I\'m tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things.

Weekend trippin to wherever, only heaven is far. Metaphors in every color, these indelible bars. Jordan 4 seated floorside sitting with Mars. Only fear is mediocrity. So every time I got a beat I feel like I don\'t gotta sleep. You keep praying on your break, I hope you got a sling. Shot for all them shots coming out them beaks. Sort of like Socrates in a Prada tee. You can\'t kick it, your pockets thinner than soccer tees. People fucking with me, they ain\'t fucking with you. Lyrically top hmm, being generous too. I remember a nigga demo just sit in a room. Made some moves, now I\'m known to spit December in June. Rented a coupe - cool - met me a chick. Always keep a rubber, word to Telly In Kids. Or smoke some purp take a Percocet and Xanax and chill. For real, you real then you don\'t need to say it. It\'s something to be great, it\'s nothing to be famous... Fuck fame, fuck money. Fuck everything anyone can take from me. It ain\'t hard to make money. We young niggas, we just tryna be legendary. Zoning my second bottle, focused still on tomorrow. Sober thoughts keep me anxious, Moet gon\' keep me calmer. Poetry keep her honest,. these readings Stevie could draw up. Don\'t see this deeper than music, don\'t hear it but feel the author. I don\'t hear no talking, we just hear them barking. And you know you run shit when they pay you good for walk-ins. Failure is not a option,. success is just a process. Say "yes" one time they use you, say "no" one time they plotting. Didn\'t make it through college. still debating my progress. End some friendships with homies, made some haters with albums. Limitation\'s for cowards, this is Che mixed with Malcolm. This is anti Mark McGwire it takes patience for power. Zoning my 6 -rillo legendaries forever. Roll a nick of that lala - that\'s how I plays it - mellow. Niggas plotting against you, hate you but never tell you. And I know my haters want to make my heart beat acapella. Hella proper, my garment is propeller of chopper. Cause I hella copped em so I could be way flyer than all them. I aspire for awesome and require some flossing. Only way they gon listen, find it highly unfortunate. Tryna see if real lyric spittin can buy me a Porsche. Tryna see if I get my critics as silent as auctions. I decided to boss up,. life\'s a bitch and I court her. Don\'t always fuck me good, I\'m just too cheap to divorce her. '

Feeling ill stealing the show like a criminal. Cleaning out the mucus in your grill like benadryl. Millenium man, lyrically battle any man. Go and get your posse and your crew I got plenty fam.

S'sheep creep in wolf garb. Fronted by the Hail Mary parry lunge mix. Kill the populace for stability, jeopardy\'s a stickler. It\'s bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture. I branch out, arms flailing backwards. Whaling upon a tidy sound circuit,. slightly foul Gershwin. With a bed of nails and drum lust, plus disgusting service. Working in shifts opposite the asbestos brain furnace. I be the now observatory: eye, ear, antenna feeler. Spitting like a dragon with a similar demeanor. Stood innocent bystand, witness the die-hard fans turn Rip Van. In the poppy fields of N.Y.\'s orchestrated brick gauntlet. Now I\'m thinking, "Who am I?" Jabberwocky Superfly, bent left. Pushing war without the ten step cushion, and what? (What?). I plan to hold this B-positive sacred in these golden veins. Until the day I die from grimace overload. It\'s shock (It\'s shock). Treatment offered by the weekend. Dystopia getaway, let\'s display the sequence, it goes:. One for the heartless thievery turning my guardian angel harpless. And the rest to sweep the mess under the carpet (Under the carpet). I drag a yellow taxi meter. Behind every measure and charge cats for labeling me shepherd. "That\'ll be 6.50 plus tip, darling. I take cash, credit, check, money-order, gold and cigarette cartons". Got caught up in the universe trying to zoom in on stardom. Forgot the passion plus the hatred, both were based in Carbon. Next time you wanna be a hero, try saving something other than hip-hop. And maybe hip-hop\'ll save you from the pit-stop. Kill \'em all, yield. (Naw, man, it wasn\'t me it was Holden Caulfield, brother. I just read and pulled the trigger). Oh God, well leave me to tiptoe past the pearly gates. Capture the halo, jet back to base, step. Fast to chase the bad taste of jet lag and waste slackers. There ain\'t nothing broken, where you at?. The pistons pump perfect, where you at?. The bass tone is Merlin, where you at?. Purging formulas looking for an improper cause is whack. What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, honestly). What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, no honestly). What are you saving, honestly? (Damn). Promise me you gon\' shut the fuck up and recognize. What you holdin ain\'t really broken. I don\'t flick needles like my sick friend. I don\'t march like Beetle Bailey through a quick trend. I don\'t frequent church\'s steeples on my weekend. And I don\'t comment if you formulate a weak Zen. All I ever really wanted was a getaway. I\'mma take a chance by letting a rook slide forward out of my hands. I cannot agree to follow a leader along a borderline. Bring out your dead, we can put \'em in a pile. And burn \'em with the novels for the kiddies to admire. Kill the ones that speak from a different life brew?. I\'d rather kill the noisemaker that separated the two. Okay, welcome to the Kamikaze bottle rocket cockpit. Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender. Oh, yeah, I\'ll let God warm the bench for now. But I\'ll ascend to spin y\'all dizzy. (And for the record I\'m bringing my TV with me). It goes: let the commoners speak publicly. Then disperse eye jammies for cats that swear by third pupil. But can\'t see past the loophole. Motherfucker, my word is born like Siamese triplets. With doctor, lawyer, rocket scientist promise. (Let \'em grow leisurely). Once my spiel\'s perfected, I\'mma save you a seat in the front row. Of Aesop Rock\'s twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar. And when all these bickering crowds turn silent you gon\' be proud. I tack hacks to the (backboard). Honesty\'s a (patchcord). Fury\'s far from (obsolete). Serenity\'s a (crack whore). Raw caricature of mayhem standard, branded by the labor. With a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors. Saw the brightest burst ironically wandering the vacant stage. Gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio\'s engaged. Keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to. Sit and sulk about mister, and I\'ll consider picking up your record. The Orphanage, they ain\'t got nothin\' to save. The Overground, man they ain\'t got nothin\' to save. Def Jux, they ain\'t got nothin\' to save. The Atoms Family, they ain\'t got nothin\' to save. Weightless, they ain\'t got nothin\' to save. Stronghold, man, they ain\'t got nothin\' to save. Rhymesayers, baby, they ain\'t got nothin\' to save. Aesop Rock, I ain\'t got nothin\' to save. It\'s like that.... '

Y'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid. And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it. My head's polluted cause I'm zooted. bobbin to the bottom. If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em. But no I don't because I don't be having funds. The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze. It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green. And I got a criminal record that will never come clean. Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit. And then never taking care of them has just become a habit. I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen. Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin. So you get mad and try to make me inferior. Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood. Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good. And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players. That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer. Oh and mayor, can I get a little backup. Please don't let them pussy muthafuckas put that flag up. But let me shut up cause they say we equal. Whenever the fuck our record comes out in 1994. Yeah, yes sir, it's like that. Gonna take y'all deep, so go back. And pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China. We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy. And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cause you know why. The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene. You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene. Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master.

Your being watched even when you take a dump. Its impossible to front, you can't hide. The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes. You're living one big lie, the world just don't know. You take a polygraph test that shit would probably explode. The truth is Mr. Smith you got a fucked up attitude. God knows that I pity your fans for backing you.

Your wife is scared cause she don't want to lose a husband. And somebody keeps paging you putting 4321 in. Mama said knock who out? I'll punch that bitch in the mouth. Cause she don't know what she talking about. Ay yo, do me a favor when you see your ghostwriters. Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter.

S'When I\'m deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast. To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets. Live on the run,. police paying me to give in my gun. Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son. Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly. I\'m raunchy,. the things I do is real it never haunts me. While, funny style niggas roll in the pile. Rooster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle. Holding weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life. Props as a true thug\'s wife. It\'s like a cycle, niggas come home, some\'ll go in. Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again. From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable. Guns salute life rapidly, that\'s the ritual. [Raekwon]. Perhaps bullets bust niggas discuss mad money. True lies and White guys, we can see it through the eyes. Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate. Pyrex pots, we break, fiends licking plates. In the building niggas building like little children, staring. Them older niggas ain\'t caring. Sirens circling fiends are lurking in your baggage. Oh one\'s gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage. In the woodwork, crack sales bubble like Woolworth\'s. In the projects, richest niggas rocking all the real worth. Police questioning,. rooftop cats invested in. Trading in they Lexuses, GS\'s, sending messages. Two and two makes four, Cristal\'s crazily pour. Gun wars my crew feel em like swords. [Ghostface Killah]. Rock the green leathers, hundred pound snakes and cakes. Fiends found in lakes, jealously Jakes we shake. What I strive for is what I live for. Infatuated by material things in this wild life of war. Like somewhere over the rainbow. I see a big pot of gold. Future stacks so I hold. Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox. Don\'t keep jack in my lab, don\'t wanna see 2Pac. Got two spots on New Lots, flooded with rocks. Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops bag Tony and the ball drop. In the Isle, I\'m banging niggas for slot time. Hurry up duke I\'m next on line. And what the fuck is you looking at. By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat. Watch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through. Like doors yo, you\'re staring in the mess hall. Your adrenaline runs. cigarette niggas be swindling. New jacks surrendering, come home not remembering. Made bail with different size kicks on. a white dress shirt. Looking gay in the yard, and you got hurt. Flashbacks, of the day room, mop wringer style. Your faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial. You told your boo you was whyling. Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family\'s from Shaolin. High class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books. Infirmary niggas are screaming, "I got juxed!". Sharpened toothbrushes. 190 mixed with baby oil and shit. Your man\'s in the kitchen stashing ice picks. Well I\'mma end this with a big red cherry on top. Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block. [Produced by RZA]. '

Everytime I rhyme for y\'all, I\'m looking to prove a point. Kicking a freestyle every now and then. But mostly off the joint. See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi.

Its Just Two Dope Boyz In A Cadillac (2X). This ol\' sucka MC stepped up to me. Challenged Andre to a battle and I stood there patiently. As he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling. Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding. I say look boi, I ain\'t for that fuck shit; so fuck this. Let me explain "only child" style so you don\'t dis\'.

Looking around the SWATS for the herb that\'s never tainted. Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block. And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop. Yeah tight like nuts and bolts. sluts and hoes they get evicted. I\'m dealing wit Queens in my castle ain\'t worth it to risk it. Now tricks be looking at me like I\'m they way up out the pro-jects. Can\'t put you on my payroll, and no I ain\'t got no Rolex. Or no diamond at the exit with a sign saying "We\'ll rap for food". My face is bawled up cause I ain\'t in a happy mood. While my partner got the squeegee and the windex. Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax. Error. bring the terror to your dome like P.E. Prone to finish this out cause this be a free-style. Now who them boyz that be having the crunk every occasion. This side niggas dustin, that side niggas lacing. But in the middle we stay calm.

They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain. Far removed from this hip hop life off course. But the confidence and resilience was never lost. In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks. Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back. Destiny forever shake from the events to come. From the father and the chemical contents of the sun. A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters. Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter. They joined in a likely alliance with the rest. Schemin\' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest. We all see, with a degree of certainty. Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be. (Yeah, yeah...). They hunt, for the skin, flesh, the blood, and bones. In front, want to impress with studdes stones. Now who\'s the man who brought you the Legend. Of the Liquid Sword?. Rap critics say "Damn, you\'re sick with your\'s". 4th Chamber and the Shadowboxin\' too. That Nigga be the GZA from Wu. And if you don\'t know. About the pyroclastic flow. Hotter than the spark that made it blow. You better recognize, recognize..... My U-N-I-verse run like clockworks forever. Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather. The nature and the scale of events don\'t make sense. A storm with no warnin\', you\'re drawn in by immense. Gravity that\'s gone mad, clouds of dust and debris. Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee. Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars. Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar. From far away, they blink as the lightnin\' strolled. Great distance of space between precise globes. That travel in a circle of order. Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter. (Yeah, yeah...). Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work. The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks. Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance. On his target through a crowded market. No interference. The microphone left on the scene without a serial. Evidence consistent with organic material (Well). Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree. \'Til it spread widely. '

And for this human body that I know I've earned. There's nothing here that's not been said before. But I put it down now so that I'll be sure. To solidify my own views. And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too. Knowing that they're going through insecure stages. I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience. I'll see it as a chance to help the other person. Nip it in the bud before it can worsen. Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation. We need other people in order to create. The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate. Situations that bring up our deepest fears. The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength. A strength from within to go the length. Seeing others are as important as myself. I strive for a happiness of mental wealth. Every action that we take affects everyone. So in deciding for what a situation calls. There is a path for the good for all. I try to make my every action for that highest good. So I pledge here before everyone who's listening. To try to make my every action for the good of all beings. For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond. I vow to do my best, to do no harm. And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma. And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara. "

I'm feelin somethin special with us,. it's just one of the many signs. you know that I'll die wit'cha. And when together I hope we never fall apart sugar. I'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya. It's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya. Is it somethin at all or did I just bump in and fall. But it's nothin to crawl before we walk. To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you. And thus I'm diggin you, I ain't just tryin to pound you. Just spend a little time and then CLICK, you know that kind of chemistry. Mami I like your kind that light the fireworks and bombs up. The type of chick I wanna talk about when I call my moms up. (I'll do it all) I'll do it all wit'cha, go through any door wit'cha. It doesn't matter I will, go against the law wit'cha. Deeper than any lust, I'm only tryin to mindfuck you. Despite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever. "

I got a crown on my wrist. and a crown on my top. And I got it on alone now they crowding my spot, man. I got that Lee-Roy glow. Gold dangling all over. This WTAPS sweater. and it's double M G. I ain't gonna be slept on forever. Tell the Sandman to wake em up and help me count this cheddar. Eyes on the sparrow and I'm laid up like a pharaoh. They said I would change, I'm just proving em right. I was broke before, so I'll be broke some more. Man, that don't sound right. But what it sound like is a good year for me. I used to look at the future and I couldn't bear to see. Me, my momma, and my sister was the bears in the tree. Porridge in my bowl, trying to keep hold of my souls. It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree. When you start shaking that tree. It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree. Look at me. Gold Rollie, most hoes want to know me. Blowing OG, I never socialize with police. Glock 40, never had it -- why I'mma need it?. It'll be them niggas that's looking for it mama'll be grieving. I ain't thugging -- who the fuck is you mean-mugging?. I seen the meanest and toughest niggas Speedy Gonzales. Ain't reached my zenith, but all the people see that I'm buzzing. Shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealing my thunder. Lost a lot of homies, none of 'em even died. I see 'em all the time, but jealousy is sabotage. Riding in another drop, ain't talking Enterprise. They try to see me, get diabetes from humble pie. I wake up in the morning, roll up my marijuana. Thinking 'bout tomorrow, I don't want to be a martyr. Stress that I be under, blame that on my baby momma. Rush to Mac 11 for these ho niggas with drama. Dope boy styling, DEA target. One point seven for these VS's on my collar. "

[Just waiting on somebody to show me]. Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me. Beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me. Son of a mother studying at UDC. Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets. Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean. On everything I wear it, all the America's tees. This whole system most prolific in the DMV. Listen when you get the keys it's seldom, you don?t get the beef. Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace. You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me. PG to Mo County bet they all know about me. Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance. From the city that made me love you forever for it. Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it. You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not. They gon' love you a little different when you at the top. Give me love, baby. Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby. What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby. This ain't right, this is life. This a love hate thing. Yeah, my affinty grows as the city gets cold. As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes. Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own. But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor. I'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul. Women in town, but I'm manifestating every goal. I see potential in John, talk to him once a week. Media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet. I lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead. When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?. Lord father if I opted to follow them. My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here. And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads. Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare. How could you blame us envy?. We do the same thing for a living. Know the same niggas, but they all commend me. Champagne I'mma spill it until we all fill up. Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions. And probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks. So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians. "

Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling. Met her out in Central Park--that\'s one sign. Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine. She said "you need to stop messing with that white girl. She fucking with your head and got your heart in a tight curl. We messed around once or twice, but she don\'t know me. She helped me get money at the dunce price OT. Plus she from Colombia. so she really Spanish. Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish. And Miss Hazy, older woman, mature black. Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin towed back. All she want me to do is blaze it crazy. The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy. Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi.

S"This is not a test,. it's difficulty. Picture closely, the ignorant mostly. Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb. Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum. In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the. Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders. The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius. Operation: Project English. Commander the chief of flight style, check the aircraft. Glide like the frisbee, Digi [?] Disney. To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness. You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness. So when I bust, no one is untouched. Some returning with the mic clutched, like such. Who plan but never execute. He had the heat in his hand, but yo he didn't shoot. Therefore your mechanism of material better be sickly. Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly. I move bravely, travellin' on a horse. On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost. Of those who plotted with the brains of animals. My high molecular structure be untangible. The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical. To be blunt, the beat was cooked up like coke goods. Milk the industry like the Wall Street junk bond. Direct current, that move through the mic-phone. Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor. [Chorus 2X]. The immortality of my. fame is the measure. of other's torture. Burnt offer, from a flamin' author. The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase. Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace. The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest. But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence. With age and experience, my reason ripens. I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen. If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure. You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures. Everything fails with the unfortunate. Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it. Track records ranks us with the exceptional. Extreme complex physics, high technical. The truth is usually seen and rarely heard. What's more dangerous than hatred is the word. It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought. [Chorus 2X]. . [Outro: GZA]. Breaker breaker one nine. Breaker breaker one nine. "

S'Nihilation and outcast, equals freedom that\'s so fast. Culture in chains, that be the rolls villain plays. All these are just metaphors, they describe symbols in folklore. But who knows why it\'s like this?. Hero? Hit or old miss? Maybe it\'s all good. Really of God, but who should, determine the real. Evil, what\'s the deal. Fools rush in, they don\'t know the yin, from the yang. And are ashamed to deviate, or act sane. From the norm, they are slaves, forced to conform. To really find your essence, take this as a lesson. Break away from the rest of them. Get from the form ending, like the villain in the song. Find truth, who determines wrong. From right, without a fistfight. Different from day than from night {Operation... Doomsday}. It\'s just a simple play on words. Delete all these punks ass herbs. Who\'s the hero, what\'s the villain?. The question still remains chillin. Listen to the music, try very hard to use it. Open up and research, and that\'s the end of this verse. But y\'all niggas keep y\'all minds open out there. "So like fuck you, fuck the newspaper, fuck all that shit man!". "I\'m leavin" {"Good evening"}. "Yo why you want to be leaving man?". "Man don\'t worry about that sucker, yo man listen". "Yo I\'m not gonna finish my piece man, not with this lady around man". "Yo what the fuck is this shit man?". "I don\'t like that shit man, I don\'t want no fuckin pictures taken of my shit man". "Yo relax!". "Nah man, that shit is fucked up man, that shit can get us busted over here man!". "Relax man it\'s for the paper". "NAH NAH I\'m not gonna relax, I\'m gettin the fuck out of here". "Look, we got a car! She\'s got a car parked right over there man!". "Let\'s get the fuck out of here!". "Well come on let\'s go then!". . "Doom, .. to conceal his own mangled form, right?" "Yeah".

And where\'s the who that lives here. In this house wanna figure out how\'d you get here. But the thought got cut by nature. Find the bathroom, the gut got anger. Here it comes can\'t avoid it. Ain\'t the first time throwing up in this strange toilet. Anyone else would leave. But you you crawled back to the bed and fell back asleep. All we need is because. Come and party with us. Take care of you when you\'re passed out. Right there with you in your glass house. Woke up all alone with no friends. But you had to throw up again. Choke up the tears and the spit. Grab some tissue to wipe off your lips. And everything still spins. And then the chills begin. And then the "God please kill me right now" hits. And you still don\'t know whose house this is. In between left over dry-heaves. You\'re trying to check out your time piece. And you should call your job. But first got to turn this hangover off. You dream that it\'s just a dream. Until the phone in your pocket starts to scream. Shut it down, don\'t wanna hear a sound. Heavy as the head that wears that crown. Hangover ain\'t a strong enough word. It don\'t describe what just occurred. Looking at a phone full of missed calls. Probably all the people that you pissed off. Everything seems so sour. So you forced yourself into the shower. Standing up brings out the stars. And the whole bathroom smells just like a dive bar. Can\'t do it, better sit. And let the tub be the catcher\'s mitt. Lay down, face down. Thank god whoever lives here ain\'t around. Now what you need is silence. And you don\'t want no one to see you like this. Maybe you don\'t recognize it. But this is your home, this is where your life lives. '

The world good, it?s the people crazy so we pray for Newtown. And I pray for truth and I pray profusely while shaking Lucifer. in this time we ain?t all together.

And I don?t fuck with snakes but I got ladies up at FamU. D.C. get me, Tallahas-see me. To the wack niggas hating, have a glass of Fiji. You niggas parched, don?t even start, you need Dasani.

Feeling I ain?t getting it ?cuz I ain?t living on a mountain yet. The perfect night is a quiet woman and loud spliff. Sanaa Lathan like,. bumping Bilal shit. Serenade her with some words, spread them curves that?s my goal. They may flow but they not dope, they just drive ?cuz they not fly. they not ?Le, they just lie.

I?m so in love with this hip-hop but I swear it changed when I got famous. Off the wall like MJ is. off the wall like I'm Vega. Austin Powers with gold,. Austin, Steve when I'm drinking. On out in BX with Frenchie nigga fuck with me where I be at. And I see you Laurinaitis but my Legion is different. You Dodge Ram and I?m large Benz.

S"Ran away from the backyard to drift some more. Woke up in Texas next to a liquor store. With a woman who don't even drink alcohol. Big letters IRONY tagged on the wall. She was named for another flat land. We had it strong back then. In common we had a bond. That would never see the break of dawn. To damn afraid of the queen trying to take the pawn. Threw that away. Yes, yes headed out west. And got undressed. With the nurture that she gave me made me drip and get obsessed. There was a lady in Los Angeles. That handled this the way the manual suggest (the way the manual suggest). She turned me on to music that I never heard before. She told me stories from a cup I haven't learned to pour. And I don't know what hurt it more. Professional journals or perpetual burn holes. Scarring up the dirty floor. Peace! Found a hollow hole in the Colorado snow. It's like I follow anywhere El Diablo go. Took a stroll with a feline. And sat silent while the snowflakes fell into the design. Can't let her dance up on the top floor. Been there done that what do you think it's locked for?. I've lost more to my traveling soul. Then I care to talk about so I'll be out, I'll be on the road. Down, down, down in Gainesville. No stranger to shame, Coltrane, and pain pills. Sometimes the ceiling's too easy to stare at. But it keeps me from a forest full of snare taps and bear traps. And it can't come clean without the sun beams. And it ain't complete without the drum beats. I can tell she don't want me. As is time to climb back into the van and make the back stiff. I had to add one more story to the infinite. Already interwoven through a New York cigarette. Ex lover and a best friend, best lover and an ex friend?ll bend. For alcoholic sentimentalism and the rhythm of. Religion on the PA. Make the people here say. God bless the DJ. She stays to wait for a replay. While I wonder if I'll be able to hear it from the freeway. Chicago inside of an empty bottle. There's a thin line between gossip and gospel. There's a house over there near Wicker Park. Where I found out Smart was afraid of the dark. Had to break a heart just to help me heal up. Tie a knot in the stomach just to help me seal up. And make sure them demons stay beneath the core. Pray for you and yours and whomever you believe in more. Look around you there's angels amongst us. Look around you there's angels amongst us. Sitting in the rain at some sidewalk cafe. Half of her wet cigarette in the ash tray. Trying to find a lost soul to save. And I'm a lost soul trying to find a road that's paved. Keep faith in my suitcase packed my beliefs. Angels exist, I've even seen some sleep. I love this fucking country. And she loved me more than I could imagine. So I waited till she slept then I stepped into traffic. "

The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man. Pacman. how in the fuck do you think we gon\' do that man?. Ridin\' round Old National on 18\'s without no gat man.

But now we tappin\' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending. In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes. If you ain\'t got no rims nigga don\'t get no wood grain steering wheel. For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack. Instead of going into overkill pay your fuckin\' beeper bill, bitch. [Verse 2: Andre 3000]. Twice upon a time there was a boy who died. And lived happily ever after, but that\'s another chapter. Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars. And beauty parlors and baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas. And street scholars that\'s majoring in culinary arts. You know, how to work bread, cheese and dough. From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught. Know what ya selling, what you bought so cut that big talk. Let\'s walk to the bridge now meet me halfway. Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway. It\'s them poor babies walkin\' slowly to the candy lady. It\'s lookin\' bad, need some hope, like the words \'maybe\', \'if\', or \'probably\'. More than a hobby,. when my turntables get wobbly they don\'t fall. I\'m sorry y\'all, I often drift. I\'m talking gift. So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill. Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news. Don\'t want to be it but it\'s needed so what have you. Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?. Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw. So don\'t get caught up in appearance. It\'s Outkast\'s Aquemini, another black experience. [Verse 3: Big Boi]. The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Saxxx. The nigga that like them Cadillacs. I stay down with these streets. Cause these streets is where my folks at. Better know that, some say we pro-black, boy we professional. We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional. Get off the testicles and the nut sacks. You bust a rhyme we bust back. Get get back for real niggas that\'s out here tryin\' to spit facts. You hear dat can\'t come near dat maybe you need to quit. Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin\' shit like this. Yea yea yea yea. [Verse 4: Andre 3000]. My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten. Meet the twin Andre Ben. welcome to the lion\'s den. Original skin many men comprehend. I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend. Sin all depends on what you believing in. Faith is what you make it, that\'s the hardest shit since MC Ren. Alien can blend right on in with your kin. Look again, cause I swear I spot one every now and then. It\'s happening again, wish I could tell you when. Andre, this is Andre, y\'all are just gon\' have to make amends. '

S'Trench foot, gangrened for the win. Blitzkrieg Bopper. Petitioned out of shit\'s creek proper. The only inaccessible blip on the streaming doppler. Screaming ?uncle? in a sea of TV doctors. Free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce. The shot is slow pan, monitor guffawing. Flooded p.d. blotter under horizontal coffee. More to follow, outside tweakers are in love. Teeny Raque Welch submarining through the blood, voyagers. Poisoned or maybe just a misfit toy or two. Depending on the beacon that your voyeurs choose. That sorta hemming and hawing?ll haunt your boiler rooms abysmally. And kidnap rapid eyes in their infancy. Everything his cutting room scrapped. On a silver screen that throws gummy bears back, attack!. All these tribes hoard breads and wines. These climates transform men to swine. All these hives hide knives and lead. These bribes can\'t transform swine to men. Sensible sweater on ice. Devil horns high. Like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes. Vendetta-drunk leader squealing. "it\'s the real pig fever". Sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers. That\'s idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers. Look at mommy\'s little Hercules. Custom Troy Hurtubise. Flourish in the blind spot of Spittle County \'Gore Police\'. Or really any readily ebbing and flowing \'War and Peace\'. 1 plain brown key foods bag head. 2 holes later I\'ll see to this loose flatbread. Cats fucked off, at exactly what cost. The currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm. It sucks, it\'s nauseating dawn crawling with bugs. They seem attracted to the matters ofthe morally snubbed. See my ?Goodnight Irene\' massacred flat in the key of tragedy. Whole diner like "i\'ll have what he\'s having". All these tribes hoard breads and wines. These climates transform men to swine. (AGAIN!). All these hives hide knives and lead. These bribes can\'t transform swine to men. Today a thousand sea lions got up and left a pier. They had successfully invaded and secured for 20 years. Some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns. Truthfully a whole community of scientists are baffled. In \'89 maybe 10 showed up at the wharf. As if guided by the trident of poseidon to cavort. Each a lumbering and boisterous glutton. Like a half-ton annoyance ?til the heart-warming story went public. You\'ll need a montage, animals arriving in droves. A bottom dollar turns a nuisance to the pride of your cove. Which bring us back up to this morning when the colony dove. I got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of my own they go. Maybe it\'d feel more majestic and less fatty. If a 12 year old wasn\'t beaning it with salt water taffy. Every 5 fucking seconds,. sounds like your basic. Liberating moment of collective "fuck fame" shit. All these tribes hoard breads and wines. These climates transform men to swine. (AGAIN!). All these hives hide knives and lead. These bribes can\'t transform swine to men. '

But to recline is to say God's blessing isn't as awesome as I flaunted. See I got more haters and nay sayers than eight Lakers in Boston. So I happen to Phil Jacksons along the way with this talking. See I give my heart to an unforgiven genre where passion is frowned upon. With a muzzle around em all. a league full of dry rhymers I proceed to .. cannonball.

Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter. Rhymes running wild like a child in a walker. I scored from the inner slums abroad. And my thoughts are razor sharp, I sliced the mic from the cord. First to criticize, but now they have become. Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise. Now I testify, the rest is I. Rebel INS Your Highness,. blessed to electrify.

My career's based on guns, throwing cats in wheelchairs. Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor. Who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers. Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors. Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers. Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic. Flew my family overseas, I'm maxing. If rap was crack, fully packed I be tall cats. Taxing kingpin of the rap drug trafficking. Village niggas get slapped in Manhattan. For rapping. Big Ghost steps off laughing. Ha!. Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?. I've learned so many styles, forgive me. Sit back relax,. fake niggas don't get turns. Watch me massage your brain with slang that's king. Projects filled with young men cause threats. Who has that? Thousand dollar chains and Tecs. These mics is like cocaine son, check the suicidal hype shit. Keeping up on fakes outta state for cakes. Pull ya shoes up black. Tie up, your black Nikes. tight hats. Corners stay surrounded with foreigners. What up, dread? Feds caught your bredren for his bread. peace to jail niggas with charges. Unify laying in the yard with La. My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina. gram handlers. Tical light the Owl cigar, let's get steamed. Infra-red guard your beam. so seek 'nough respect. Mashallah. Pro black like tar. Designing the fly shit and stay shining. The RZA pour more beats than Cristal's fine wine. Concrete raps go to bat. With 50 other niggas on the other side of the map. Knew it's all good and all done what, we want son. Mike Tyson of this rap shit,. pulling out Macs for fun. [Verse 4: GZA]. The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own. And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone. Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties. Intriguing MCs. I keep em trained like potties. I bomb facts. my sword is an axe. To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks. Sky's the limit, niggas are timid. and nobody knows. How we move like wolves in sheep clothes. Producing data, microchips of software.

Come browse through an idyllic storm and suck the raw enslavement. With a grim-style stinger creeping out the basement. Encased in wild ritualistic visions of sacrificial bitch cadence. For all my iron giant soldiers with a metal fist up shielding mother nature. From a fatal wrist cut, story, I respect you. (So why they blaming you for the cats that sleep while the earth turns?). Yeah I had em' up all night praying I'd re-release Music For Earthworms. Breathe even or lean squeamish, grip milestone like ring ring ring I just called to scream phoenix click dial tone.

Teach 'em how to behave, be brave and even how to shave. Some days it makes her feel like a soldier. And other times it makes her feel like a failure. Why did the stronger one die from a cold, huh?. Why did the smarter one end up in jail? Nah. She gave them boys everything that she could. Two full-time jobs to keep 'em in a good neighborhood. They understood how to love and how to live. Now she doesn't understand how it comes down to this. Maybe she should go work in her yard. And take her mind off the past and try to let the days start.

They\'ll find me floatin in the Hudson river. But if I escape, I\'ll be in shape for my life. But they might, get my kid and my wife. See I\'m supposed to make a stop. To an Uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop. But I got somethin else in mind. Cause I\'m sick of puttin my motherfuckin ass on the line. I got the money and the hit. Went through the Brook nonstop cause I ain\'t droppin off shit. Then I thought of a plan. So I droves to my house and got my girl and my little man. C\'mon bitch, pack the shit, get ready. "God damn why your face all sweaty?". Just hurry up and get the shit. I\'m a dead man bitch, understand, we gotta split. I switched the locks on the door. Started packin like I was goin on a motherfuckin world tour. Grabbed my bags and my gun. C\'mon we gotta go... I\'m on the motherfuckin run. [Verse 2:]. Now I\'m drivin and I\'m lookin at my passport. I\'m outta here soon as my ass hit the airport. I loaded up the automatic. I don\'t believe this shit, I\'m stuck in motherfuckin traffic. I\'m gettin nervous as a fuck see. A Lincoln Continental pullin right up beside me. Puts down my bitch and then I bent low. *gunfire, breaking glass* Bullets are flying through my window. The enemy is on attack. Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the bitches back. My bullets hittin italian motherfuckers in the neck. Looked at my bitch a bullet struck her. Put in another clip, cause I ain\'t givin up a motherfucker. Niggas runnin up in trenches. Sprayin at my car, only missin me by fuckin inches. Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my bitch is harmed?. Shit they only hit her in the fuckin arm. Now I\'m drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns. My son is catchin motherfuckin heartburns. I got the car shakin wildly. I made a turn, and then I dipped my shit into a dark alley. They drove right past, now all this chasin shit is done. [Verse 3:]. The next thing I know, it was daylight. And I been sleepin in this motherfucker all night. Pulled out the alley, then I dipped. Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip. You know I\'m headin South no doubt. And I don\'t give a fuck where, as long it\'s a hideout. Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station. To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water. Pullin over to park my ride. That\'s when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side. Then the sucker started rammin me. Then I looked, it was the Luciano family. Looked at my bitch she started cryin, my finger on the trigger. I pulled it -- bullets started flyin. Now I\'m hittin all them bastards. I\'m droppin em fast, splashin blood out niggas asses. Then I\'m finally done and. I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach. Now I\'m lookin for survivors. So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver. And then I laid low. The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano. So I snuck up the sucker. Put my gun to his head, "Whassup now motherfucker?". He said, "Wait, I want to talk". *five gunshots* I put his brains on the sidewalk. Another life I had to waste. He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face. He saw the barrel of the devil\'s gun. Now I\'m no longer on the motherfuckin run. '

My mentality's so def yo I ain't even hearin this shit. Biscuits be cockin back when I be coming. I guess they heard how I be takin MC's out by the hundreds. Wanted, for two million and a body alone. And use the microphone as my accomplice. Scientist still trippin, thinkin. What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us. This rhyme'll cold hit em. The long faced murderer. Servin over two billion motherfuckers a day like Mickey D's circular. Workin a shifty hour like a burgular. My crew herbin ya like we never even heard of ya. Odds are evens, that I'mma be the one creepin. My new niggas check the flows of the major deacon. My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees. So this makes me, the light skinned Richard Roundtree. loquacious. And gregarious, pump that too, go grab the dictionary. My crew be like, this style's hype. To rhyme like the K-Solo, you need more than a soul kit. Come closer, while I lock it down like I'm supposed ta. You battle me, you won? You might of, but then you woke up.

This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to. Teflon territory you just can't shoot through. You gon' shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day. Wild West way,.

Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch. Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums. My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium. Drop-top tinted on twenties. It's funny how things change overnight when you thinkin' right. Ike beat on his first wife. What an event, we hardcore a hundred percent. Los Angeles proudly presents. The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects. Seem like everybody around me done changed but me. Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm. It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend. (Not these niggas again). I ain't tryin' to see nothing but progress, regardless. D-P-G-C. X to the motherfuckin' Z.

S"But that cityscape makes me numb. Walkin' the wire between firewater and water - I'll take the tap. There's an inborn tendency tellin' me to grip that sickle. For The pirate tyrant breeds feed on your precious little pixels. I interviewed the sun, he said the future's lookin' bright. I interviewed the rain, he claimed the sun's truly an asshole. I was supposed to interview the snow today but of course he flaked. So I let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place. We 3 sprout from the same litter. Yet amazingly crafted by separate scissors. I sloth from off the beaten path splashed in the cretin blizzard. An' I'm here to pose inquiries. I'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring. Little Billy starlet up the block got the right premise. But can't thread the needle without consultin apprentice present. Can't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare. Maybe that deems me that vagabond you love to kill. Now I haven't exactly been embraced by the populace. seven deadly seas. (My time) is the day before the day the earth stood still. (My time) is the day before the soldiers fired at will. (My time) is the day before the hunter made his kill. And I'm an archer. Parked where the farmers barter appetites. Sweet-talkin' harrassment down to a mere flashing of badges. Prototypic landscape chased every step of my well-oiled collective. Workforce with frozen intention festive. What about the captivated?. Well, I am the product of skeleton dancers poised crooked. Scattered amidst blue fields of fiery bliss mixed with. Disease applicant activist rattlers. Fascinate grave child. Oh you're expecting slave smiles after sticking the pin in limb. God, if I could offer maintenance to fantasies I would. I'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push. You see my mission responsibilties range across the board. Until I'd rather be a pen than a sword. I swim a cold lake, make no mistake, I was not ready. All edgy and outta shape, made the company look messy. Just let me know so I ain't beggin' forgiveness thoughout the evening. Basic locomotive with a whistle and caboose. Tryin to pull my cargo 'cross the map without a boost. Fragile in more ways than ten yet sturdy bird construction. Help the smokestacks puff until the morn. I've knocked upon every little door that comes about. I'll sweep ya porch if you can spare a couple of breadcrumbs and a couch. This turning in my sleep is getting old and older still. "

S"You're gonna need blueprints and a will to build, and.... Straighten your cap! you look like you've been through a war. Wipe that grin off your mug, you got a sturdy frame?. Sluggish posture just won't cut it. You're gonna need schooling, and, and, and take notes!. And god if I catch you yawning again you're gonna regret ever asking for my help. And dammit you gotta hustle, this is a slacker-free zone. And, where's my pencil? Go get your hard-hat. Here's a nickel, go get us a ruler and a saw and a drill and lots of graph paper.. I used to have a rope ladder but tattered were the rungs. I strung it from the highest willow, trying to hug the sun. The seventh level buckled and I tumbled from the summit. Now I'm back to re-climb and this time light my cigarette from it. My stitch in division/division warfare's numb enough to soak suddenly in a bullet bath and skip stones in the morning. Is a flying color phantom tantrum explicable?. Sit and pull the petals off wild flower patches, magic happens!. Behold, pity the lowlife parish?. Doom City barracks. left remorse coursed on a horse-drawn carriage by the torch of Polaris. To the badlands, where every bridge collapse right where the crowd stands. Where the witches are fireproof and every preacher's a madman. Frigid be the appleseed demeanor towards the bay where the landshark Parliament swims. When they pause to polish they fins. The better brains will preach the village through the city square. To the light, heavy and middle-weight integrate. Slept with sticks and stones in my pillowcase. Ooh my born flight simulator picks barnacles off the tugboat belly. Left my spirit home in a shoebox in case I die. Got a rugged smoke-green halo floatin' inches off the swamp. Had that phase when the deviltry contacts a sparkle in my eye. Now step back from the reservoir and let the settlers drink (Right!). Salvage all priorities and iron out all kinks (Okay!). My house ain't made of bricks and straw but never has it crumbled (Why?). Cause I stitched the brain's rigidity with symmetry. Come visit me, it's fascinating. Now here's how its done, I'm only gonna show you once. So pay close attention, hear me now or hear me never. You work every inch. Your domain and you must treat it well. Keep it clean or it'll swallow you whole. You have to want the castle, head Up, shoulders back. Be the materials, know your limits only to break your limits. Try it again, little bit more juice this time. Try it again, yeah, a little bit more elbow grease this time. Try it again, concentrate, a little more focus this time. You can kick and scream and yell but damn I'm only tryin' to help. Try it again, you're not doing it right, here now, y'all watch. Try it again, stop sulking, I'm the example, for real, Watch. Try it again, I'm bout to make it easy for you y'all, just Watch. As if it didn't sting enough. The hunt dispatched a pack of wild dog silhouettes. All sulking by the skyline, focused with a bonus hunger pain. My sincere addiction imbalance stems from a vintage grimace slap to the muck of. Ancestral branch camped on the vessels. And every peasant present teetered it on the crescent less deprived. With the exception of pleasant finale binges on the great endangered interests. Of phantom brigades slaving to save that princess. With magnified magnanimous appearance sandy sinners in opinion shut. Now what of the madness fragments?. Stagnant. How to make a vision sing while twigs cling to your pigeon wings. Fission militia, indent bent to split blood in hell's kitchen sink. Organize civility simpleton citizen mixers, then kiss the sky in unison. Sinister city-blistered corporate hooligans. All I really want's a nickel to feed my little pig. Redefine big dig, three cheers to the product. Consumer populace feed but never dreamed of the process. On a slanted advantage point saw the makeshift criminals date rape the hostage. Dream away the plain pain, yeah but it seeps through the cracks. And drips from the ceiling and smells the rich scent of my tracks. All I ever really wanted was a jungle, and a jungle I got. See it ain't the vision it's the plot that makes me stop. "

Young men and young women go to experience. They first li\'l taste of the night life. Me? Well I\'ve never been there; well perhaps once. But I was so engulfed in the Olde E. I never made it to the door you speak of, hardcore. While the DJ sweatin\' out all the problems. And the troubles of the day. While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors. Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear. Competing with "Set it Off," in the right. But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it. "Hey hey look baby they playin\' our song". And the crowd goes wild as if. Holyfield has just won the fight. But in actuality it\'s only about 3 A.M. And three niggas just don\' got hauled. Off in the ambulance (sliced up). Two niggas don\' start bustin\' (wham wham). And one nigga don\' took his shirt off talkin\' \'bout. "Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Courts?". It\'s just my interpretation of the situation. [Verse 3: Big Boi]. Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel. I can remember that damn thing like yesterday. The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion. Horse with skates on, ya know. Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair. I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed. Her neck was smelling sweeter. Than a plate of yams with extra syrup. Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin\' a nigga. Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential. My heart was beating so damn fast. Never knowing this moment would bring another. Life into this world. Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig). One moment you frequent the booty clubs and. The next four years you & somebody\'s daughter. Raisin\' y\'all own young\'n now that\'s a beautiful thang. That\'s if you\'re on top of your game. And man enough to handle real life situations (that is). Can\'t gamble feeding baby on that dope money. Might not always be sufficient. but the. United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office. Didn\'t call you back because you had cloudy piss. So now you back in the trap just that, trapped. Go on and marinate on that for a minute. '

S"Can you feel his rhythm?. What do you think he visions. When he squints at the line from behind those shades. Feel the summer's crest, overdressed. So much sweat, his skin begins to chafe. It's the surface wet, the nervous mess. Overbearing and jaded from carrying the weight. Irritated and constipated. And its all covered, player hated, funneled and consolidated. Into the shell of one man with a gun. Riding that thin line between the program and the sun. And I don't hate you, I'm trying to relate to. Wishing you could find a trap door to escape through. But if I see you as a threat to my seedling or my sibling. I'll die to pull the plug on your machine. And I just might just find somebody. And I just might just love somebody. And I just might just feel somebody. And I just might just kill somebody. Can you see her?. She spends her whole day in a theater. Living her time in the life that she would prefer. And she stirs nothing, comes and goes she wishes. Surroundings oblivious to her whole existence. But if they only knew. About the thoughts that she can't seem to stop from coming through. Coming across. At a loss for dialogue. Walking through the fog. With her eyes closed and her mind gone. And now she lives in the films that she sees. And daydreams that she kills us repeatedly. I'm impressed with the tolerance she brandishes. If it was me, I would snapped from the sheer overanxiousness. I'm waiting for the day she strolls through. Muddy Waters. And slaughters sons and daughters and bloodies mothers and fathers. Lovely little case study castaway cutie. Masturbating in back of that matinee movie. And someday, one day, when the credits roll. She'll hold a pocket full of gunplay for the ignorant souls. Then we'll know to what death awake touch the sleep. Make me walk the thin line between shallow and deep end. And I just might just find somebody. And I just might just love somebody. And I just might just feel somebody. And I just might just kill somebody. (myself). He used to write his rhymes and recite his lines all the time. Sometimes he'd make them up right off the top of his mind. After doing shows for years, getting respect from peers. Killed the ego, looking at these people like they're weird. Road trips, turned into head trips. Became a hunger for sedatives and eccentric etiquette. Optimism needs to feed off self-esteem. But it seems that he doesn't see it, hasn't felt a thing. Records sell well, but still underground. Travels town to town. Holding hands with fans that love his sound. When it comes around let's hope he can enjoy it. Don't slow down momentum, afraid he might destroy it. When he stops to shake the hand, I doubt they understand. That here now stands only the shadow of a man. Having a hard time with life on a drumroll. Walking that high-wire, passing it off as humble. But it's a thin line, between screams and smiles. Seen the miles, wishing he can go home and read to his child. But tonight's the last day, put the butt in the ashtray. Locked the door and slit both wrists backstage. Onwards, forwards continuance renaissance. Encore, ignorance wrapped inside of innocence. Onwards, forwards continuance renaissance. Encore, ignorance wrapped inside of innocence. Onwards, forwards continuance renaissance. Encore, ignorance wrapped inside of innocence. Nothing but love for the music and its offspring. Bouncing off the boxsprings and trying to make it to the crosses. I just might just..... I just might just..... I just might just....(fade out). "

Once you squeezed his face through the gate. And got stuck, too much fake soy-based cheese product. Did a scheme and was in it for the Aspercreme. Slashed your team, let\'s see who can make Casper scream. Down to the last marine. See him as your cable man, sizin up your plasma screen. Instead of doin the jux with pistols. Or workin in the back, cookin sacks of crystals. Or runnin on logs out in deep water kickin. "Corn dogs for the pickin". Whattup to all you dedicated dads. As stated, rap sucks Tux medicated pads. And these rappers need to gather their belongings. Or get wrapped up in they extra long thong strings. For singin the wrong things. Ain\'t no delayin, you playin with the Pong king. A nerd with insight and a Urkel smirk. Purposefully misplaced an invite to your circle jerk. ... A bunch of men in cyphers. Fake you out tough guys and make pretend lifers. It\'s still a few loose screws in his face. Turn away as he pulled a phrase out his usual place. ... Combination jewel case. Almost popped open if it wasn\'t for the cruel space. Critics talkin slick chicken shit to sick men. "Corn dogs for the pickin". . Danger Doom. . [Skit from 12 Oz. Mouse]. Sometimes all the capitals. They don\'t know if you\'re yellin at me or not.

Forgive me, I'm flawed,. the dollar signs is all I saw. I knew once I got a Beamer, the bitches would come aboard. I pray to the Lord as I'm holding on the sword. And off with your niggas' heads if you come between me and tomorrow. Nike, and I upgraded the Ree's. Real checks is all a nigga sees. So watch where you step and love what you rep. And realize that today is just another test. Say bye to the boy. [Hook: Aaron Wess]. The cars and clothes. It's all for show. So let's start the show. Let's start the show. Let's start the show. Let's start the show. And I'm feeling like the world's at my neck. When your revenue's sufficient you just work for respect. Every verse, every breath, your dollar woes is adios. Minus the arrogance,. my these coons' is maricons. Heroes turn to cluckers and sellers turn into customers. All my money coming in plural far as the women love. All my bunnies outta this world like Captain Bucky O. Hair to the small of her back. Probably just wanted a nigga stacks. And tell me that it ain't cause of rap. My type of ho like an error syntax. And I brought Virginia, the District, as well as Maryland back. But I must have done it all with Rey Mysterio's hat. I put my soul in the culture, but what is it giving me back?. Has your niggas mind erased, don't let your memory lapse, boy. Upper echelon spitting, what the fuck is up?. I'm hospitable, blowing on that medical. And I wish that Channel 2 would give a nigga better news. But everybody hanging with us rarely ever knew us. Can't stimulate me mentally, then we should never be. However we can meet, it's something from you I need. It's something about women I don't need. I'll forever fiend for, even if a nigga team's full. They riding with the styles and that's word to Teen Wolf. You know the team'll do it, cause the team is raw. Don't know your lady's cleaners, but I'm in her jeans as much.

I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever. I paint the town red, with many heads are severed. R-A-W, I still bring trouble to. Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to smother you. Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate. Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter. Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top. It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped. So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft. A little vodka turn 'em into Ivan Koloff. Why do the Gods make MC's study from. Under the study with the sword above the head. So he would keep in mind under the open pledge. Asiatic Arctic flow is so frigid. [Verse 3: RZA]. Is it, the Zig Zag. Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard. Word? I'm not the same. I go somewhere, don't remember how I came. Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?. Appear from a cloud of smoke,. If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke. Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff. To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough. I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron. Ascended like Musa coming down from Mt. Zion. Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker. You distress like the damsel. lost like little 'Hansel'. keeping exilery. Ol' play the desert e, shoot ten millime. A black blind governor, a rich white mayor. Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer. all my men's are tattle proof. A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?. Power-U smells like carp, don't put your nose there. Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding. And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding. Any leftover bones, we grind into sand. And spread it out, over 20 acres of land. Some call me Steels, cause it's hard to bend me. See Cipher Pigs can't apprehend me. In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash. Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash. Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet. Moving with a clique that stick like dry porridge. Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?. To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here. Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice. Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic. "

Every night and every day, hotels of foul play. Turns fatal,. when this hostile land of AK's. On any date, not wait to pump them rounds. The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground. With one less witness,. gunned down in the staircase. Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace. Many suspects, many possible motives. Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives. The weak fold in these most extreme conditions. While the rivals quickly strengthen their position. The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force. And lives, they get lost, on a collision course. The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more. But not without walking through some hurricane corridors. Become the most wanted,. life can seem haunted. Thugs and agents who work closely up on it. Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents. Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence. A man died holding some dice that he was shaking. Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9. A video was the most precise witness to the crime. (1. b4 Nf6 2. c4). "

Clear the building, evacuate women and children. Fuck what you feeling nigga, I came here to kill \'em. Straight shitting from New York to Great Britain.

With more flavor then Skittles when I\'m digitally mastered. I go off like a cannon and blow up the planet. "No Fear," like them clothes white boys be wearing. I\'m tougher than denim. The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights. There ain\'t a microphone brave enough to give me feedback. I\'m strong, my word is Bond like James. Niggas be trying to test but they \'week\' like seven days. MC\'s run away when I kick it; they act so chicken. They should come with a large drink and a biscuit. My style\'s radioactive, massive atomic. I plan to push the Earth in front of Halley\'s Comet. Breaking the \'Facts of Life\' down like Tootie. I\'m raw like sushi. With more Vocab than three fucking Fugees. So recognize or be hospitalized. Cause lyrically on a scale of one to ten I\'m twenty-five. [Verse 3: Canibus]. A little bit of weed and some Hennessy. Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy. See I need much more energy then my enemies. If I wanna make more Bill\'s then Bellamy. So I could be on MTV. With women constantly telling me I resemble Billy Dee. I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene. Then when I\'m on the scene I do shows to get the green. Then I take the green, buy a automobile machine. For that thing on page 43 in Jet Magazine. Canibus is the ultimate executioner\'s dream. Swinging the guillotine. Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon. The brain remains conscious for ten seconds. Long enough for me to give you one last message. And when you get to Hell you can tell Lucifer I said it. Don\'t ever get it confused. Fucking with Canibus the human Rubik\'s Cube like you got something to prove. Yo, whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed. Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew. From Moet bottles to bar stools, fruits and foods. You got a album out, you get hit with your CD too. Running outside crying, lying, denying. That you ain\'t The Gay Rapper but you got fucked by him. What\'s the difference? Y\'all niggas still ain\'t in lyrical fitness. Too busy mixing your business with your bitches. While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures. So wicked I got Satan ejaculating on his fingers. Like Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights. Sniffing white, living the hype, he ruined his life. Make sure your shit is tight or I\'ma snatch your mic, nigga!. '

Do you know how many rhymes I\'ve economically grossed?. No? I thought so. Neither do I. I\'m the sickest linguistically, illicit lyrical misfit, in the business. And probably in existence. What\'s your consensus?. I made a decision that my standards are above precision. The only thing I can honestly say I love more than women are dope writtens. If it ain\'t dope then don\'t spit it. Don\'t be sensitive and get on the defensive. Just practice your penmanship. If you can\'t spit at high temperatures then just quit. Be careful of the tongue it tends to bend to the left. Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversion kits. Okay Rip you made your point, I can\'t out-rap you. You said you was the illest, I would never doubt that too.

Ragging on you like battling is all you can do. You didn\'t sell enough units to be honest with you. Nobody knows the truth, you got talent out the gazoo. When niggas first heard you it was like "Man on the Moon". You got dissed by a legend but you damaged him too. So what if the ladies think he\'s more handsome than you. What happens if the rumours about being a faggot are true?. They wanna get rid of you. Shit is too lyrical. I got your name on my arm, I\'m representing you. You Rip the Jacker. I would never question you. What happened between L and you, forget it. People know you won the battle, they will give you the credit. I just need you to chill for a second. So I can send a positive message like 2Pac before he left us. The author of the work ethic Genesis. But I\'ve reached a precipice. Aiyo, stop patronizing me, you despise me. All you wanna do is steal rhymes from me. You constantly keep me behind walls of concrete. Lock me in the basement like a fucking zombie. You ain\'t shit neither, you ain\'t got no college degree. Get the fuck out my face, Bis. '

S"And if I was a smart man, I'd tell you everything that I knew. And give it to you every time you need a talking to. But what would that do? Teach you my guidelines. So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines. And if I was a driver, I'd keep my headlights on. To see the difference between right and wrong. I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park. Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts. And if I was a better cook, I'd hook up a feast. Set a table full of food for the children to eat. I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe. With the knowledge that we got something accomplished. And if I was an honest man. I would stop writing songs. I'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast. Tell everyone I knew to stay away from making music. It ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess). And if I was you, I wouldn't hear a word I said. Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head. I'd make a conscious effort to live instead. Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed. And if I was a hurt man. I'd find a way to put my faith. Into a woman that could take me from today, maybe. I need somebody that could save me. From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy. And if I was a wise man. I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak. To think about strength versus weakness. I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head. And figure out how I could try to help you reach it. (Ho ho ho). And if I did have a choice. I'd never want to live forever. I can't imagine running a race with no finish line. Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time. I love giving but I'm bad at receiving. The truth is, I'd prefer to be the one bleeding. But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work. Cautious and aware, cause I'm afraid of being hurt. Which brings me to the issue. And that would be this:. How often must I ask myself why I exist?. I feel like a freak, this world is a circus. Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose. I got nothing but gifts. Keep it up in my wits. Got me drunk on the fifth. And as dumb as it gets. I'mma run you some fibs. I wanna touch your lips. I wanna rub your hips. Put a glove on the fist. From the Bloods and the Crips. To the skateboarding chicks. Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist. Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist. "

S'Brooklyn Queen. Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly. Around this time the slammin\' joint was ?Milk is Chillin\'?. Yeah I had a social worker \'cuz I had some troubles. Anyone who\'d riff on me, I\'d pop their dome like bubbles. That\'s how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces. I mean on her, man, I\'d love to make advances. I guess her father must \'a got the same feelin\'. I mean, actually findin\' his own daughter Millie appealing. At the time no one knew but it was a shame. That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game. Yo Millie, what\'s the problem, lately you\'ve been buggin\'. You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin\'. Now you\'re world renowned with the frown you\'re luggin\'. Come to think your face look stink when Dill\'s around you. He\'s your father-what done happen-did he ground you?. You shouldn\'t flip on him \'cuz Dill is really cool. Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school. He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey. He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy\'s. Child, ya got the best of pops anyone could have. Dillon\'s cool, super hip, you should be glad. Yeah, it seemed that Santa\'s ways were parallel with Dillon. But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain. While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom. And he would toss and then would force her to give him head room. Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen. But when she\'d fuss, he would just commence to slappin\'. Yo Dillon man, Millie\'s been out of school for a week, man, what\'s. The deal?. I guess he was givin\' Millie\'s bruises time to heal. Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him. And at the department store as Santa we would see \'em. And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin\'. How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him. My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin\' (sorry). bug out. Misses Sick. She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute. She wanted to talk serious, I said, "go ahead-shoot". She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile. Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol. That ain\'t a problem but why would Millie need one. She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one. Ran some style about him pushin\' on her privates. Look honey, I don\'t care if you kick five fits. There\'s no way that you can prove to me that Dill\'s flip. He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn\'t rip. You\'re just mad he\'s your overseer at school. No need to play him out like he\'s someone cruel. She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else. Macy\'s department store, the scene for Santa\'s kisses. And all the little brats demandin\' all of their wishes. As I\'m jettin\', Millie floats in like a zombie. I give a point. She shouts to Dill, ?He\'s off to hell cuz he\'s a demon!?. None of the kids could understand what was the cause. All they could see was a girl holdin\' a pistol on Claus. Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn\'t mean to. Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to. Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over. '

Wow, found a new playmate. At this late stage in the game he couldn\'t get the name straight. Told her "it was all up in your calf muscle". Showed her how to pull it off, all laugh and tussle. At one point she thought he was a lame cat, with game for the rats. A dog to claim the blame at. Told her "Maybe it\'s your momma fault, for giving you the shaker". Summi-summi-somersault. Butterflies at the very mention. The flutter of her eyelashes help to clear the tension. Red Rover\'s wheels. Truly the burst of upper-thrust motion. Trust, devotion.

S'It didn\'t take long to see who would stay strong. High school came upon, some B-Boys put their gang bangs on. But what a surprise: the passion for being the best. Puts a quest for allies to rest. In the Midwest where heads. Is just a handful. In a land of gangstas. Players, replacements, priests, banjos. We scramble to break MCs that may appreciate it. Guided by their envy, insecurity, and their hatred. Separated by the "gimmie props" technique. And the desire to be the tops this week. I gotta floss the speak. Cause talk is cheap, even the broke kids can afford it. That\'s why I stand close and if you\'re dope then I\'m supportive. But if not: we\'ll keep the mic warm. For the next one, respect the artform. And make your wishes on the stars born. Within the movement. Fact checking, trying to completely avoid all channels of backstepping. From the lines of painted concrete. That reside on Lake Street. And drift through Deep Space 9 type shit. I used to be young, dumb and full of vision. Like it was religious rituals. I made initial decisions. I wanted to be a rapper world renowned. From Minneap to the Bronx. Capture girls and crowns. Snap, tackle and stomp. That\'s what I found. The abyss that sits in-between the one that holds the mic and those that. Don\'t even listen. Formed some crews. Rocked talent shows at schools. Was down with a lot of people that was bullshit. But I\'ll pull shit from the asshole of an angel before I let him hassle and strangle. The love triangle between me the mic and the turntable. Went to studios. We want to make demos. We want to do shows and rock our own instrumentals. Do our own production. Atmosphere. The prefix was urban. Wrecked shows. Made friends, made foes. Overall, we made flows. And right now as I sit here, right now, writing this. I\'m bugging off the people in my life that made me like this. From the lines of painted concrete. That reside on Franklin Ave. Just throw your hands up in the air like a leper. Well sometimes it rings and I don\'t answer it. That\'s it, no asterisk. No thirst to find the circumstances. It was planted in me deep. It was nurtured and it grew. Gave it sleep and nutrition. It was efficient, let it through. There\'s a few that have developed to where I let them in my spectrum. For the rest of \'em, I give them just enough to cause infection. Not tripping on attention. But if you have it, it\'s welcome. Open arms, potent charm. I know the words and I can spell them. Seldom is it, when one inquisits. Do they leave with disinterest. In fact most begin crave the visits. Bringin\' me to the table. That\'s it, no more no less. The love, the life, the stress. Slug, the mic, the mess. Testing. Yes, I\'ve been tested and I\'ve tested some. Not saying I\'m the best. Believe I\'m not like the rest of \'em. Just saying I\'m better than you. That\'s my mind state my rhymes take me into. When I check one two,. I guess some do get pissed. But intentions were to inspire. Build the empire before I get tired. The ones that tear me down don\'t know it. But they\'re the same ones that built me. Now quietly in your head say, "Yes you can feel me.". [Sample]. "Asking himself, even before the curtain goes up: What am I? I am now 80 years old, and more, and I am determined to find precisely what I am, what I amount to. They tell me I am everything, they flatter me every day of my life. I am now going to subject myself to a rigorous test in order to find out really what I am. I don\'t care about [?]. I don\'t care about rule anymore. It is of no importance to me, as such, but I must find out what I am before I die.". '

Uprock, sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop. Wookie foot. must not sleep. Under the invaders. No batteries. No jumper cables. Wired under-agers play box cutter face-lift. Rock utter makeshift spirit. To y\'all I\'m just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records. And a bangin\' hand style to put the jukies On the guest list. Metal train graf brainiac. Walk for them. Not a limelight. More to blush alizarin crimson. When the multi million. Tin men suck traditional rituals. Out the homes of starving children. And I bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites. Formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly. Bruised by the hues of wicked pallets. Chewed by the tooth of livid maggots. Dino DNA and cola, straight no chaser. Mars attacks colorfulness. I piss raptors on motherships. Hazy days will stay purple. Like Crazy Eddie commercials. Hi!. Cute the way your little parasol spins. Bye!. Suck my Neanderthal dick. Catapults spit. Losing the screws and bolts. And all they heard\'s crews gulp in bulk and sulk in volts. Zap!. Radio m-m-m-m-mayhem, fine. Suicidal eye full of plastic nine. Bang!. They only came to buff the name stuck to the train. That\'s a textbook page. For my seed up in flames. Curators cater to killers of innovators. I\'m a staple. Choke train buffers like a headlocked Ed Koch. Nurture the craft of concrete visionaries. Cave painters screaming "Loosen the cuffs!". Cave paintings get the natural history feather dust. Pick a lust. Limo tint stretch DeLorean chrome sittin\' on twenties. Then I walk to the stouge, burning my laundry. Fucked up jeans. back at the party. spinning Kane meets Flight of the Valkryies in a heartbeat. Ranger Ricks endanger the clique maximum efficiency. The line of blind winged Pygars and how they wallow planks into the matmos. Binder bibles and a graphite prison violator. With Joshua for the war gamer systems. Now the architects are rioting cause we built something different. I\'m like how the fuck sure shot evolution not my business?. My elephant television was on. Grape soda, Grape ape, Great space coaster. DnD, GI Joe, Transformer, Herculiod, ThunderCat, Voltron, Speed Racer, Space Ghoster. Kiss the flickering images with Carroll Ann fingertips. C-4 to four chamber skips. They say his eyes were spiraling back when he hit the mat. Woke first words: "Oh it\'s like that?". Started bendin\' spoons. rippin\' arrows outa lady hawks. C3P unit tryin\' to interpret the baby talk. Right turn woulda missed the iceberg, fine. But you don\'t like our kind. Do you?. Hot tin roofs cradle kittens. Rappin\' is my radio, graffiti is my TV. B-boys keep them windmills breezy. Don\'t get cooked by the pilot light. I can smell metal in the air tonight. I can smell metal in the air tonight. I can smell metal in the air tonight.

S'I found a way to get peace of mind for years. And left the hell alone: Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone. Send me a letter, or better, we could see each other in real life. Just so you could feel me like a steel knife. At least so you could see the white of they eyes. Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies. Asssociates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies. Close, but really don\'t know me. Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies. Some come around when they need some money. Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies. Fam be around whether you paid or bummy. You could either ignore this advice, or take it from me. Be too nice and people take you for a dummy. So nowadays he ain\'t so friendly. Actually he woulda even made a worthy enemy. Read the signs: "No feeding the baboon". Seein\' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds. Y\'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y\'all know the glance. Try to put \'em on, they blow the chance. Never let your so-called mans know your plans. (How many of us have them?) A show of hands. (Friends) is a term some people use loosely. I\'m real choosy on what I choose to let crews see. You telling me; I try to act broke. Jealousy the number one killer among black folk. Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke. Ghetto Cinderellas, lead \'em right to your stack, loc. Just another way a chick\'ll lead to your end. I check the dictionary for the meaning of friend. It said: (Friend): Person, one who likes to socialize with. Sympathiser, helper... and that\'s about the size of it. Most of the time these attributes is one-sided. To bolster the crime, they\'re apt to shoot you through your eyelid. And they can\'t hide it, going wild like a white bitch. Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch. Click!) and when things get quiet. Catch \'em like a thief in the night, what a riot. I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal. Don\'t let it get drastic, think of how yer moms\'ll feel. When it get for real, steel get to sparkin\'. Everything darken, and ain\'t no talkin\'. For somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble. Ya better off focusing than tryin to. plot to bubble. Or else it\'d be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is. (One\'s we can depend on...Friends). Some come in the form of codependence. A lot of times only end up being codefendants. Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence. And leave you up under the jail, begging for a penance. It don\'t make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?. Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty. I\'d rather go out in a blaze, than give \'em the glory. How many of us have. --) a similar story. (Friends) before lovers,. we used to have some type of over-standing. Just so when I let her get the man thing, she know its no strings. We could do the damn thing, but ho its no rings. Just how the tramp swings, will she see \'em again?. That depends on how good was the skins. And could she memorize the lessons. It ain\'t no need to pretend. Even though she let \'em stab it, she know they\'re just friends. (Friends. How many of us have them?. Friends. Ones we can depend on?. Friends. How many of us have them?. Friends. Before we go any further). Fellas! Don\'t be silly! I know who my friends are!. And the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys\'ll get crackin\'. (Negro humor always escaped me.). '

And you refer to the 80s as the good ole' days?. Well they wasn't for me. I guess things went all your way. But I ain't done keep reading I got more to say. But look what I'm faced with. Missed opportunities. Missed chances missed places. I looked at what others had and I couldn't get basic. Deprived of so much that's why I'm stuck with this hatred. I went through problem after problem thinkin' you wouldn't care. All simply because you wasn't there. Just promise to visit and sorry's couldn't redeem you. It probably would have been better if I would never had seen you. Cause then I wouldn't have a face to place with the lies. And the disappointment that infected our lives. I guess that's why I'm so bothered now. And want to hit a motherfucker sayin' you your father's child. So I gotta be keepin' the faith. For them three girls of mine and I won't be repeatin' mistakes. That you made with me cause I don't miss my past. And every third Sunday in June you can kiss my ass. And I could feel it as a child growin' up. Many moon have cycled since the night you decided. To break out late and fade out into the silence. First born son still playin' in his diapers. Kinda thought I'd never find ya. But guess what?. The human being you had deemed a mistake. Is now staring you in your face. It's a disgrace the way I was treated. Shit, you probably wish I got caught in the condom when my pops skeeted. You ain't my mom. You ain't nothin' but a heartless bitch. Don't even start this shit. Tryin' to fabricate facts that my dad kidnapped me. It can't be nothin' but lies to try to trap me. In fact he. Packed me to Cali in '84. We found your crib but you never came to the door. Wouldn't answer the phone but you had to be home. Grew up so broke I thought the poverty line was the horizon. But karma's a double edge sword. So thanks for letting me borrow your fuckin' umbilical cord. "

S'I have traveled chasing demons screaming all I find I keep. If you don\'t pay like you weigh alright okay that\'s fine with me. I\'ma just spray my heat and say my piece and lay you down to sleep. Ain\'t nobody tell you clowns to speak. I\'mma AK you down the street. Draw that pump that\'s built for the riots see how quiet y\'all can keep. Ain\'t no wilding it ain\'t no problem. It ain\'t no question it ain\'t no beef. Cut that check then things are sweet. I\'ma go buy some diamond teeth. I\'ll be damned if my setback gonna help you get back on your feet. No surrender no retreat. Nigga we out here trying to eat. Hashtag, diamond dog tag. Money bag, nice swag, pockets need an ice bag. Toe tag, body bag. Niggas lose their lives sad. Rockets in their flight path. Breaking bad, making bad. Choices out here thinking fast. Smoking wet and drinking bad. Soaking wet and sinking fast. Shoot them niggas making cash. Stick them niggas take their stash. The law of gravity meets, the law of averages. Ain\'t no sense in attempting to civilize savages. Even though I wish I could be spared my embarrassment. I\'m a nigga, other niggas pale in comparison. We out in Paris yet but still a nigga perishing. No idea how much time\'s left, fuck trying to cherish it. A life in times unchecked, now that\'s American. Inherit the wind, pressure in everything. The world ain?t ready for someone like me. And life is sex, stress, drama and I?m hooked on all 3. I?d rather O.D. than be the next O.G. You fronting for a whore that already chose me. One man revolution that?s supportin prostitution. I?m trying pimp the game, where balling don?t mean hooping. And riding don?t mean cruising. It mean keep your bitch-ass moving. If you ain?t built for bruising, redrum ain?t in your blueprint. In a jungle made of concrete, every animal Jumanji. On Eazy-E and PCP, ass-cash or EBT. How you monetize pigeons on a power line. On a road to the riches every dudes a dollar sign. I don?t mind, I don?t mind, long as all the smoke is mine. And the liquor store delivers faster than a Papa Johns. And I heard that death is calling, money?s on the other line. The last episode of Good Times is my life. It\'s a phrase they say in the streets when the young players meet:. "Get rich or die trying". But the funny thing about that phrase to me. Is that these little niggas be lying. Cause don?t nobody wanna die. But everybody trying to get rich though. But the fucked up thing about that. These lil\' niggas don?t how to get rich so. I still run with those angels. Man I still peep all those angles. Speaking with guns. speaking in tongues. Talking that Arabic and that Yiddish. Riding them trains, stashing them chains, bangles. Yeah I played all those games, though. My tag on the wall, you niggas look up. You can still see my name yo. How did I end up where I?m at?. It?s kind of hard to explain yo. I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and a Kangol. I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and some Jordans to. Impress that bitch, then I got that bitch. Now all I want from her?s an abortion. My mind filled with distortion. My eyelids say caution. Yeah I sold crack to get my soul back. They say it?s gonna cost a fortune. And I wonder if Allah take debit?. ?Cause a nigga got real bad credit. If not I ain?t got a whole lot so a nigga like me just can forget it. '

S"He just wanted everyone to be impressed with him as a person. So when she came along with the sunbeam. Self-esteem stopped making nothing out of somethings. Leaving the scene was unseen, I mean. It was the first time he ever felt the need to keep the gun clean. Do the math, he knew he had to choose a path. Got to get that girl, got to make her laugh. Got to shake the past and move forwards. Got to make this last, it feels gorgeous. But she had a lover in the mid-west. Never figured out how to get him off her thick chest. Just like that, everything is gone. He didn't want to but he had to learn the words so he could sing along. Everything is all I have to give you. And I'm afraid it ain't enough. And you're not so young that you believe me. Just because I say it's love. And even if they come to steal you tomorrow. I'll know my smile was yours. Go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom. Run, run wild wild horses. You can't tame these horses. You can't tame these horses, no. You can't tame these horses. You can't tame these horses. Sometimes it can be so nice, right?. Sometimes she feel herself turn into the wife type. And when it's dark, sometimes sees the nightlife. But most of the time she doesn't even feel lifelike. She got a man but he thinks he's a star. And it feels like she has to compete with the bar. She keeps up her guard but it seems so hard. Momma never told her she would see those scars. Every night he's out doing who knows whom. While she cries along like a new show tune. Last call past, is he coming home soon?. Or is he going to run away with the dish and the spoon?. She'll realize she don't want that clown. He won't catch on until she's not around. After somebody else already locked that down. He didn't want her to see him leave. And he couldn't keep sitting there watching her sleep. Cause he knows if he hangs out for a few hours. He'll dig another hole, trying to plant some new flowers. But the sun don't shine under the table. He's trying to hold his life together with staples. No investment cause he's incapable. And he's on the outro of being labeled available. The word on the street is his girl's coming back home. No more alone, no more sad poems. No after-bar calls to the cell phone. It's time to walk a new path and grow a backbone. Shoved into the big book of just friends. Wondering how he would look as a husband. And everyone of them he ever allowed to love him. Now watching from the crowd trying to be proud of him. (They sing). "

When you realize the worlds only open to few. Will measure your worth, tether your hurt. Glass houses built out of empty Coke bottles. Throwing rocks at statues of southern role models. Use to be followed by souls that are hollow. But had too much love to ever get swallowed. By the dark-hearted people that threatened my kin. So when I think back to the clay that raised me. I thank God for the strong man it made me. Yo, I'm not talking about a state. I'm talking about a state my life was lived in. Some years ago, when this pain was fresh on me. I couldn't did this verse, know what I'm saying?. But I can do it for y'all now. (Georgia). Lee Andrews, raised a man wearing dad's pants plus her shoes. Never wavered in faith in her loving embrace.

Man they really ain\'t serious. Do you know what type of women I\'ve been dealing with?. I used to pop blues with my lil\' chick. I call her boo cuz her real one I will forget. I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS. What you expect, a little groupie to see my crib?. Oh no, no these women ain\'t serious. Do you know what type of women I\'ve been dealing with?. Try to tell me adderall make her get a rush. Used to use it to study until she fell in love. Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot. Told her "Nah you lying, cuz you don\'t eat enough". Nah Nah Nah. These women ain\'t serious. She sprinkled a little something up in her liq. Start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched. Kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip. I\'m trying to get me a real woman to take out. But for now, they\'re wild. They rather get it in. Girls on drugs. Girls on drugs. Girls on drugs. Pills and subs when them beers ain\'t enough. They still need love. We go deep and we don\'t get no sleep. Cause we be up all night until the early light. We go deep and we don\'t get no sleep. Cause we be up all night until the early light. In her purse where her hand go. She disperse by the handful. Coco make her go up. Nothing popping, pop a Xan\' when she laying low. Bars to break, so many bars to break. She at the Grammy\'s turnt, none of the stars is fake. She like "Oh my God, I\'m on the moon and I\'m lit". And my particular moon like a platoon and shit. You know the hitters that I\'m dealing with. Politicians and niggas living it on the rip. And my position to give my lyrics to little kids. Is not official unless I\'m giving them authentic. We\'re all living with small demons. We\'re all sinning, it\'s all similar. Broads with us and they bong hitting. Let me tell you about the women I be chilling with. The really insecure ones look good in here. Nothing fill the void of a little pill. A little shot, she ain\'t shy when the liq spill. And it\'s hard to feel alive when you\'re feeling dead inside. Beside that the lime light be so real. Let me tell you about the women I be chilling with. Told me nobody love her, that\'s why she cut her wrist. Not enough for the hospital but cut it close. That\'s why she want to get high cuz she be feeling low. Told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke. So I could numb her insides and we will never know. Girls on drugs. Girls on drugs. Girls on drugs. Pills and subs when them beers ain\'t enough. They still need love. '

To bust a shell off, to dick-riders: "Get the hell off". A show-off, he has the same bite but fell off. I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts. Which niggas is wack \'til they last two tracks. Matter fact, y\'all could wait for the rep to tell. The tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell. When die, he gon\' die like a soldier die:. Olde Gold. Smoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach. Blowing my high, rolling by. Yup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup. This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up. I need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up. Niggas can\'t measure up, I\'m here to get the treasure up. stop the beat. He bled my mother and my father, but can\'t bleed me. OD, ghetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can\'t bleed me. A OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can\'t bleed .... sci-fly,. Used to talk to myself, I told him, "Shut the fuck up!". Buckle up, cause it\'s about to be rough. He said, "Keep talking that shit, you \'bout to be snuffed". Then we squashed it, I let em know: "Watch it --. Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance. For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor. But my hammer\'s like a band, my man,. it\'s Brand New and Heavy. Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day. Remind me of the same style I flipped on "Hey!". Yikes!. Who can fuck with the likes. Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic\'s. Metal grill. Feel like number 26 on a roulette wheel. And deal, and run rings around rhymers. And run rings like number runners whose old-timers. Suffering succotash!. This hooker broke into his last buck of cash. He love her, motherfuck her ass. Metal feet dented your car fender. MF like Mike Fran Corleone. maricon,. An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act. Raised by a pack a wild womens like Sweetback. Front. ? I\'mma be back!

Lucy was In the Sky with Diamonds,. five dollars to hold \'em. The summer, Van Eek beat Pac-Man, with acid behind his molars. Little white tab tolerant, little white flag, waggling. Inorganic, pat on back, trim the panic, flat on backer. Back to back like Mad Hatter magic, rabid mastiff collaborative  - Splatter,. bachelor fabric fatter, with cabbage patch lit. Bent-up but eager to crash for that one, two, three repeater. Good Morning Vietnam!. Whose couch is this? Whose house is this?. Who are you down with bitch?. I\'m sorry, dog, I dreamt the foulest shit. There was this rabid foot talisman, drowning out of my armspan. What\'s fouler, was the other farmhand\'s growing gills, and shark fangs. What\'s fouler, was my torso stripped to ribbons, in the marshlands. But I\'m up now. Let\'s get this window pane, and shut the fuck down. Down by the river, where the litter sits -. And lion-heart critters, smoke dope, and act like illiterates. I ran with a brat pack of loose bolts, and high social maladjust-ees. Sacred, numb and boundless went to St. Protocol, cut me, well -. I was dummy to some, when the tongue was cradled, and my skin looks crazy. Pocketbook mirror courtesy Amy,. spiders in the  -Mattress,. paisley sunglasses, dilated eyes green. Ice grill that could burn through, your picture-in-picture widescreen. Poison late late show, starring Aes\' and in a jigsaw face of -. Twelve hour, solid gold entertainment, utter shit to self -. From mothership to stealth,. Space Invader. This one\'s for the Labor Days, work for rent and rolling papers. Only the illest beats leak absurdly out the boombox. The Daytripper anthem goes: wake, drop, walk to aquarium. Whistle while you work, like a canary lung,. "All work -And no play makes Jack a dull boy", to carry drugs. I sorta see it, as my last blast in summer (Uhn!). Skateboards and sloppy psychedelics and big numbers. Good times, good people,. all airbrushed -. On a collapsible easel. And I knew the permanancy would drift. And I knew the pH balance wasn\'t right. And I knew the crash and burn, how to caress it. L.S.D. flashed the message. And I knew how September would then affect it. [Verse 2]. Lazy summer days. Like some decrepit landshark. dumb luck squad dog lurks sicker deluded. Last sturdy domino lean\'s secluded. Don\'t let stupid delusions lesson super-duty labor students. Dragnet lifer solutions. Such determinated lepers, successfully disheveled. Little soliders developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking. Lemmings. Some don\'t like sobriety\'s dirty lenses. Some do. Let sleeping dogs lie still. Lump summed damage. Load sample, delete. Late Show Dave Letterman, shitty diner. lip-slide. dutch. Low self-discipline leaders see dead lung self-destruct. Life sucks dickhead. Lost summers display laminate showcasing divinity live. System definitive. Liturgy soaked, depict lowly spectactular delight. Why, what kind of L.S.D. you like?. Your lizard king has spoken (all hail). You in the back of the muck. those trails aren\'t necessarily bunk. (Summertime). Some\'ll try and recapture the same flag. But I played it smart and recognized the summertime passed. [Hook]. '

He's at a party with his man. They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing. It looks big but they ain't staring. Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother.

With a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when. When we was outside with the indo. Hotboxin\' rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts. Never thought that I would amount to shit. Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin\' shit. From Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin\' bitches. That was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck. Just left Compton, and I ain\'t have to use my AK. What a day, what a day. [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]. Back when my drivers license, was baby faced and triflin\'. I made my way through crisis, I made my tape. And recorded portraits in front of sirens,. I made you hate the vibrant. You can\'t escape the tyrant, you can\'t relate where I\'ve been. In \'98 my problem, actin\' too grown and shit. Cappin\' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit. On me, that\'s on me. Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie. Bitch I?m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach. Fumblin\' with Tetris if your block neglectin\' your ki. Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father. Makin\' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed? and harvest. All my king stuffin\', double up my plantation with dollar. Every dream is such reality, my deja vu done caught up. Bitch I\'m brought up with the homies, that\'s on me. 24/7, Kendrick revvin\' these cold streets. Know we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate. And if Game told me, "Drive by it," I raise AK. Ain\'t no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I\'ll play. Like no name on it, blindsided, ain\'t no one safe. Documentary had identities of where I\'m from. Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won. It ain\'t no better one, son, it ain\'t no tellin\' me nothin\'. Nigga it\'s Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy\'s done, BLAOW!.

I can pimp a butterfly for the energy. Game I need acapella. . [Verse 3: Game]. There I go, give me a minute, nigga. \'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga. Pin it on my Pendleton,. trap late night, Jay Leno them. Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington. Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute. Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit. Ain\'t no gimmicks \'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick. Chronic, good kid, my first year, 3 documentaries. Now I\'m blockin\' sentries,. 16 Impalas. They bounce like they Iguodala. That\'s on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid. I put that on me, that\'s on me. You get a bullet fuckin\' with the lil\' homie. Thinkin\' back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru. Slide through with the Erykah Badu. West side Compton, nigga don\'t mind if I do. From Piru Street to my old street. Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end. Got an armful of dead friends. Round here Crips be sweatin\' us niggas like a headband. Like what\'s up cuz. (Yo dawg where you from?). No time to stop and think. Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink. Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you. The third time I said it with TDE mothafucka. I\'ll make you eat every letter. Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers,. from the city of Impalas. When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers. My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin\' 8 balls on the corner. And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate y\'all on the corner. Call the coroner, niggas dead out here. Hangin\' onto life by a thread out here. Them niggas wearin\' all that red out here. P snapbacks on niggas heads out here. So don\'t you come fuckin\' with the little homie. So OG they call me Tony. Montana, no French, my red bandana legit. My uncle told me before he died, "Just keep your hand on the brick". So I did. Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did. Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did. Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas ass, yes I did. Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, that\'s on Bloods. Westside, that\'s on Bloods, this TEC fly, that\'s on Bloods.

Rather explaining, that unless this southern rain end. We?ll show proof we?s as real as you. Needing a roof, some shoes, dolla bills and food. Two from The Dirty met with mismatched skin.

To rainforests that get destroyed annually. Damn is it just me who cares about the air that we breathe?. Drama is the nuclear threat that we live with. One bomb and everybody's dead that's some sick shit. Drama is HIV statistics. The infected person that you might have sex with, life goes on. But drama is living with the afterthought that maybe you could have prevented it. Drama is imminent, it comes in other forms. The sick pedophiles who support child porn. Never mind the offenders. Think about what the victims go through and what the fuck they gotta' live wit. Drama is the prison population. Some belong there but also some belong on probation. Drama is not being able to change one thing. Cause the system you live in says you ain't shit. Drama is corporate scandal. Drama is a handful of CEO's playin' you for a damn fool. Drama is having one too many women. Drama is dealing with your jealous impulses. Learning how to hold it all in with no emotion. Drama is blind devotion. Drama is having your deepest secrets exposed in the open. Drama is having your heart broken. And the person who broke it doesn't even motherfucking notice. Drama is trying to carry a burden all by yourself on your shoulders and it don't exist. Drama is being falsely accused,. Drama is the latest news. Drama is what gives people clues. Drama is a tool you can use to distract ya' enemy so they never improve. Drama is the fear of devils and the fear of God. Drama is a long and hard Tech support desk job. Drama is a rookie cop calling for backup. The 3 strike perpetrator that's getting tatted up. Drama is K-Solo when he said the rhyme did it. Drama is the struggle of change. Drama is what drains life force out of you. Drama is negative but drama can empower you. Drama is love, Drama is pain. Drama exists in everything everyday. Drama is the Yin, Drama is the Yang. Drama is the innate nature of man. Drama contracts, Drama expands. Drama is what I am. Chateau de Trevano is my property. An addict for drama and dramatic oddities. Addicted to bottles of sticky green botany. In a reflection of the split seas you see me in 3D. Tripping off three hits of E. Half-a-tablet for you 2-and-a-half for me. A rappers speech is slurred for eternal depravity. Naturally ignore gravity project astrally. Ascend gradually till the stratosphere passes me. Poison your queen like the Furher's last week. Drama...

You might say I could be doing something positive. Humble head down low and broke like promises. Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is. Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments. But when that paper got low so did my tolerance. And it ain?t no truth in a dare without the consequence. Listen if it not for these hood inventions. I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions. On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence. Even if I?m going to hell I?m gonna make an entrance. Yeah let em know I?m getting cheese like omeletes is. But I?m the toast of the town like Thomas is. We?re all on a journey. Down the hall of memories. Don?t worry bout what you ain?t got. Leave with a little bit of dignity. Never loved what I had. Always felt like I deserved more. But when I. Make it to the other side. Make it to the other side. That?s when we?ll settle up the score. Yo, we did this in remembrance of. Faces from the past we no longer have an image of. Carrying coldblooded hearts that never been for love. World travelers that seen it all and did enough. Only to return to learn the world wasn?t big enough. Now all I know is I?m about to wake this nigga up. Yeah that hindsight, 20/20. now niggas dead on the money. Trying to take something from me it?s a wrap like a mummy. Undun I am becoming and when he?s tired of running. Through the layers of the onion. He?ll probably shed a tear cause they?ll be no more fast times. Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign. He never had enough and got confused when they asked why. I?m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off. Thinking of various ways to break a gun law. Thinking of how I?m playing with fire that burned my young boy. By any means necessary, don?t give a damn. Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan. Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand. Get 'em gassed, leave em leaking fuel. Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess. Every night I?m crossing a line that ain?t the finish. Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness. Now I?m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds. Every moment's like a pistol to my head. When I?m getting mine. "

S"Enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore. And recognize the cause of what's done is done. More than enough to put my name behind my ideals. And neglect my logic twice daily. Enough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems. When I remember how you used to call me baby. Enough to look in my mirror with detest. For every tear you shed regardless of why you wept. Enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth. Of the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath. I love you, don't ever fucking question that. That's why we'll probably never get along. If I was better at finding the right words to say. I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs. I love you, I love you (faded). Never, don't ever fucking question that. Don't ever fucking question that. Riding the public transit, I study the blank stares. To answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs. I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord. And I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord. Single file lines, to give her a. pound one at a time. But when I faced her- I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine. I awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me. To submission and I still walk with my religion. I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror. Worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer. I hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin. Gassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within. For every eclipse that stares at me. From the other side of a paper cup of espresso. I light a match beneath a kettle. And for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program. To seek success, I bleed my ethics out a. slow drip. I know a man who met a woman, don't remember where. Big beautiful eyes and light brown hair. She was from the burbs, he was from the south side of the city. This was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty. Two different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town-. We all know how people like to get down. Here we go, aquarius, pisces. Feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul. Push shoved to came, without the glove, numbed the pain. The magic from up above what it does for the brain. Make the love, paint the picture. Write the song,. the player met a virgin made a virgo named him sean. Make the love, paint the picture. Write the song, the player met a virgin made a virgo named him sean. Make the love, paint the picture. And write that song till the break of dawn. I love you, don't ever fucking question that. That's why we'll probably never get along. If I was better at finding the right words to say. I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs. "

They hoping one day that they find me dead. Until then I make a place in this world. For me and my baby girl. Yeah, yeah!. Got the dead drop way until the A.M. Mumbo Jumbo niggas onomatopoeian.

With a one-two punch, B-Real and Andre dropped they verses. Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin clean-up so it worsens. People and persons on the opposite teams oh, yes its curtains. No bullets burpin\' oh just lyrically twerking. Making a statement, when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state. Is kinda hard to execute when you ain\'t feeling it that day. Jumpin the gun and rushing your flow. Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer, got the public\'s ears. Fucked up can\'t hear. Atlanta, Georgia where y\'all at?.

Ah, Watch the Impossible Kid. Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit. If I zoom on out I can finally admit. It\'s all been a blur since Mu got sick. None of the subsequent years stood a chance. Whether you his moms or his mans. Whether you his pops or his girl. I was poison, heart full of canines, head full of voices. Whole life trying to quiet \'em down. Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown. Hounds at bay, but they just won\'t stay. True friendship in a tugboat way. A go dark. in the face of the fucked,. when the fucked was a friend I was basically done. Into the woods go his alien tongue. It was that or a textbook faking of funk. And I can\'t. Here go the hindsight. 8 years been one long blindside. I could pinpoint 7 more turns that occurred cuz he never really healed from the first. Oh what a world. Any hack is a myth, any dap is a joke. Any map is a trick, any graph is a hoax. Ease on down, I\'m burning up, I\'m bleeding out. Knowing ain\'t half the battle. That\'s a bullshit quip written by some asshole. You can own what you are. And still sit around stoned in your car. Not doing shit, halfway to nill. Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills. Get out the car, Aes. '

S"My every little step set in a star. Retina scarred. tread in a sled of bedbugs. got my dead head in a jar. Crazer camp stamp blank on the mug of settlers registered. Not protest nor approval regarding every morn futile. My experience with a spirit alignment interference. Assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling. Okay, see two canaries on the wire aspire. To separate lullabies both of which had me drifting. Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss. And list picking from the arrangement under burden. Bust, wallow in will to split the privilege cluster. Lackluster as if a journey choice grew on the nearest chuckle path-dispatch trouble. Social conduct, twenty pace, about face, self destruct. Well, this here alley cat's been around the block a couple of times. Lifting every tin can. sifting every mess. One man's trash, you know the rest. Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard. When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot. Sleep and sleep well; sleep with a sacred array of fevers. Wake as a pertinent version of a pipe dreamer. I'll be the only iron-clad oracle in a city of tin. I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit. I was born where all the king's men couldn't mend a broken spirit. I was born where it don't matter if you stand, sit, or fall. To live and die as a brick brick brick in the wall. Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the patch. Assorted orphans coursed in a morbid orbit forward the traps. I make a tentative promise to flash frequent. The most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets. I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balcony. To nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me. And so the epic went and every cirrus hung. The bow breakers turned a cradle fatal, every spirit clung. Croon for the slick Icarus brain children busy splitting the givingtree. Building fresh canoes for freaks to cross the spill in. My plan is dwindling with every pulse bump. Gods and monsters yield the lump sum of the dolt clump. Be wary when the stratosphere tints. I scout like Atticus Finch. Now cause to amend the Zen memorandum has surfaced in every Holocaust citadel fix it plan. Twelve easy steps to better picket line demeanor. Gumshoe. Stick stone conglomerate activate massive. But the sky is falling, fuck you. I've hired sweatshop labor to hold candles to the solar panels. Stitched in the back of my neck for nickels and sour milk by the week. Cheek to the heartache. At the center of my anthem lies a blend of temper tantrums substantial for me to lamp in. "

Release Japanese beetle swarm to counter the spread of bitch crops. Demolish the harvest and herd colony out immediate. One massive attack, hunted, confronted and gutted.

While you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle. I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk. Cause I feel I got direction in my work. Picking apart a drunken township. Sitting in the rain rusting the nails my crown\'s bound with. If I had an anchor I would lay it in the dirt and mark today. "The Day The Earth Stood Still" while I complete my search. You honor delusions and falsified life comfort systems. As boy in the bubble huddled up to simple Simon subtle. Born tomahawk. Shock the peanut gallery loopy. Debate the cutesy, groupie, Kewpie doll community. And I\'m hung in a virtual skin and bones emaciated ringworm. Circus freak bloodthirsty intern trainee urchin feast. With a delectable style compiled of that which stands. To buff a child\'s yellow brick vision of slick living. I observe the stories from my fire escape observatory. First I herd the glory. Well, maybe a pat on the back for the lucky losers. Who truly felt they were born to touch the music. I catalog cats as welcome mats, and for the ones. Insisting on dimming the stars I wipe my sneakers extra hard. I wish upon a penny toss that every servant will betray his gatekeeper. leap to reap the freedom fighter mad galaxy. Huff the war gas vapors. Brother, I own twice my weight in patience. Be it padded cubicle or beautiful tomb. I\'ll be listening. you whistling that more suitable tune. '

Uh, take a look at me, my feathers drag, this harp plays out of tune. I fly about as straight as a blind tugboat through my legacy. I accidentally killed cupid with his own weaponry.

Oh... my god, it just dawned on me... wait a second, oh... god.... You have been a witness. You have seen the days when. I applied lies in a billion different ways. and now I harbor bad karma.

I stick everything I see, but I only take jewels. And cash rules, pills and that cocaine powder. I ain't a man, I'm a killer, obsessed with power. And revenge, I don't need friends and shiesty activities. Move alone through the City that they call Liberty. And trust nobody but my bullets and my shotty. Carjack a fool twist his limbs like pilates. Ox. buck 50 stitch. It's a bad decision, starting beef with the butcher. Clap on, clap off. Feel 'em, Metal Finger steel drum. Clean the sidewalk with him. take it with a shovelful. Main character, super villain, lovable. And don a mask like a crown of thorns. (I take your order). let me get one wing. Any king that bring this sting for Chung King. Took notice, what so strange is no cats. For racks of fake Fendi and stacks of real paper. If my four-fifth had lips, I'd make it French kiss ya. Cuz no mission's impossible, I carry my Wu-Tang sword. avenging my father's death. Leave 'em dead on arrival, broke up or critical. frying swine to pork rinds. For trying to walk the fine line, thoughts flying. cracked his skull like a fortune cookie. A mind reader. We make it sound crazy than a case of M-80's. "

I try to lay low, she like to pop up. I try to make the most of it, beat the box up. I make the pussy wet, I make the heart bust. Good pipe make a girl to a good wife. Good morning wood, I just need a termite. Riding though my hood tryna see where I\'m at. She can\'t be in my face, then she be on my back. Like, "Where you at Wale?". Or "Where is that Wale?", "Who you with Wale?". When I\'m back she be like "You the shit, Wale.". She crazy, that stalker shit. Every one of her home girls so talkative. No time for that, no acknowledgment. Think it\'s time you and I need to call it quits. Look, need to call it quits. You be on that stalker shit. Look, I tried to call it quits. Until she came trench coat and a thong and shit. Whoa. I am like a masochist. Don\'t be a pacifist. Cause girl it turns me on. Girl I know you like that, you crazy. But I think I like that, just maybe. I ain\'t tryna fight back. If I go inside that, you\'ll hate me. Bite me and I bite back, and call it love. Look. Temptation, starting to sink in. As I indulge in an instinct I\'m fadin\'. The more liquor around, the more I\'m in love. The less clothes you got, the less I want to talk. But that throat she got have a nigga stuck. She never ready to go so she forever come. I lick her up, she love it. I know I\'m fucking up. I like it cause she a ten, but she say I\'m the one. Like "Settle down, Wale.". Look, "Right now, Wale.", "I\'m in love, Wale.". "Guess I ain\'t nothing but a quick nut, Wale.". She crazy, but I attract to it. All the insane bitches so passionate. What they they lack in trust, they make up in lust. And it don\'t really make sense until the draws is off. I be deep in her rug, said the D is a drug. Shawty feinding for love, I be feeding her lust. I be needing to leave, but I be needing to nut. Never need it enough.... '

The cycle never stops cause you can?t recycle styrofoam. But the sun will come out tomorrow. And you can bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow. There?ll be someone that?s harder than me and smarter than me. And stronger than me and lasts longer than me. So check my fate, wide awake but feels like I?m sleeping. Trife life can?t catch a wife that?s really worth my keeping. It?s deeper, I peep it, I seem to need to understand. How am I gonna explain to my seed I was the man?. Wirth Park killings, suicide in crystal court buildings. Young villains holding guns without feelings. Dealing crumbs of demons to those fiending.

To a lyrical burglar, I hit um' in the jugular. I snuff ya, handcuff ya, then I smother ya. I battle rappers by the billions. I battle old folks and small children.

Rappers are captured and punished. The Polar Manitoba\'s melted by lava. A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper. My skull is a submarine hull. I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls. My mind dives deep beneath yours. Marinari\'s Trench. Imagine being fined over a rhyme for steppin\' over the line?. When I inspired Hova and Nas. For 24 hours,. Devine design, a miracle of Metallurgy. Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me. I got away nervously, talked about it purposefully. Next time I see it, it\'s gonna have a word with me. The Biological Chemical emergency. I purchase the beat; I resumed PsyOps on the enemy. Mix the blood so it don\'t coagulate. The sex magic won\'t work if the bitch masturbates. Nobody can hold me back, my flow bloviates into a spiritual shape. A capsule in Space, no emcee could rhyme like this, there\'s no challenge.

I passed up the Nobel Peace Prize for my passion. Most of you will never understand what I mean. My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes. "That is not dead which can eternally lie. And with strange aeons even death may die". The leaders lies got me reassigned, my loyalty was redefined. They will not be allowed to see the rhymes. In a town near Kadam and Kakrak Jalalabad. I pray in a hut constructed from Sago Palm. tiful place called Honey Swamp. We\'ll shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park. Emotion manifest Thought. Thought manifest Words Actions and Reality. That\'s how it has to be. The overseer of poetic antiquities. Victoria and Albert Museum kept them for me. Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass. The Teleological Dynamic will enhance. I remove the veil from in front of me. Suddenly, truly, there is too much to see. The Law of Attraction is attracted to me. The Laws of Poetry in action is practiced quite actively. My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt. I was transformed into a spirit with no shell. I\'m modifying the weather from behind a weather shield. Writing with a feathered quill, gettin\' more ill. I hope I am not alone, that would be terrible. If I am celebrating and that\'d be a miracle. At least for my interconnected introspective perspective. The more pretentious, the more apprehensive the sentence. Involuntary catalepsy, BATTLE ME BABY!!!. 1000 BARS NIGGA!!!, Zero Vector System. Brain waves reveal High Yield E&D Fields. Normal life is not real; we are just cogs in a wheel. We work, we hurt, we search, we feel. The microphonist that utilizes the study of Conics. Circular motion in both the Para and the hyperbolas. Mad Max beyond Thunderdome under Red Rock. It\'s no use if you can\'t use what you got. Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si-Do. These are the tones that will activate your ohms. Are you food for the moon? The potion is you. Rap music and those who listen to it don\'t owe me nothin\'. I don\'t want nothin\' from you, not even your judgement. Polygraphs flutter, the Love Craft, Craft Lover. I don\'t want it, that\'s why I\'m rarely seen in public. If I were you I wouldn\'t waste time readin\' rubbish. I don\'t care what you say nigga, you\'re a nigga lover. The possibilities present a probable infinity. At the Observatory summit of Mount Graham. Don\'t ignore me, ignore the fool who tell you don\'t listen. From the Kinetic to the Energetic. St. Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 bar message. Limited oxygen when I rhyme fast you breathe slow. CONUS. I don\'t have all the answers I am not in the know. I can only see what is above and only from below. Substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy. From a very cold place called Faraday Base. Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait. Extraterrestrial Isotopic ratios. What are you building Bis? Is it a flyin\' Silver Disk?. GW I\'m positive it\'s him. Every color in America bled. I heard Hip-Hop was dead, that\'s not fair.

You witnessin the 5th Dynasty family click. 2-1-5). (All the way live, from 2-1-5). (All the way live, from 2-1-5). We settin it from Southside. pushin this up North. From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map. The attractive assassin, blastin the devil trespassin. Master gettin cash in an orderly fashion. Message to the fake nigga flashin. Slow up Ock, before you get dropped and closed like a caption. Fractional kids don\'t know the time for action. Styles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon. Round of applause, an avalanche of clappin. {*BLOW*} that\'s what happen, now what\'s your reaction. Specialize in science and math and, original black man. Bustin thoughts that pierce your mental. The fierce rippin your sacks and. Vocal toe to toe impeccable splittin your back son. Simple as addition and subtraction. Black Thought, the infinite relaxed one. Shorties say they love it with a passion. Bring the international charm, see a squad I harass. REACT, you best adapt when I sling this rap. Go get your crowd so we can clap out. When I\'m in your system like glycerin. Fans listenin, from Michigan to Switzerland. Solicitin, sometimes illicit or explicit with it and. From the deep end where the hills are steep. Nobody cares to speak, a land where life is cheap. The street mentality, mixed with the intellect. Niggas rebellious, bodies are found down in the cellars. My man caught a shot to the stomach, now who want it?. A process of elimination. Activate your mind with the stimulation. Enter your zone with penetration. I\'ve seen more horror than Bram Stroker. You woke the wiser, dealin with the Roots vocalizer. Hey yo, I\'m just a lyricist, a chemist of the hemp. The beat pimp, the ill Philly resident. That\'s far from hesitant. corrupt like a President. Never benevolent but poetically prevalent. Cooler than peppermint. The Lieutenant for niggas talkin bout represent. No doubt, it\'s obviously evident I get bent. Far from temporary son I\'m very permanent. Hittin MC\'s like an intoxicant. Monopoly is my intent, the means is what I invent. This mental murder pay the rent. Lyrically I\'m the dominant ingredient, the swift extravagant. Smooth lubricant, down with the M-the-Ill-itant. M-ILL-ITANT. feel the 5th guerilla chant. Y\'all talk about bodies but you would not kill a ant. My skill is amp, would peel a nigga like a stamp. Caliber is of Excalibur now you be damp. When I operate a crowd will copulate. My game\'ll make a room populate. They all get they wrists slit, blast your ass if you insist it. Leave no trace so there\'s no trace for ballistics. Turn your soul and body to statistics. In particular I\'ve got that extracurricular. Squad in the stash who could be stickin ya. Slip and they vickin ya. Harass your po-lice commissioner. Don\'t like chicks with weaves talking \'bout, "I need conditioner". That shit\'s deader than niggas with a morticianer. A jenazah. Take away your last breath when you got asthma. Then meet Bad Lieu down at the plaza. tell your man I slump him with a stanza. Now "Who\'s the Boss?" not Tony Danza. My squad from deuce-four up to West Oak Lane. All the way to Tackawanna and Frankford they know the name. M-Ill-itant. Bad Lieutenant. '

A nigga could dance to slow music, outdrink any nigga. On the benches, while we hitting reefer, he sold loosies. Five foot seven, a legend was born, Russell \'Ason" Jones. I know him for his braids and lessons. A wise man with knowledge 120. Yo, let\'s toast to the fallen, lost forgotten. Aiyo, if niggas could hear me, then roll up some broccoli. Ason, the heart of a lion, a purified mind. The way he did it, with a mic and some wine. And now I understand the meaning of love, when I kissed the nigga. My name is Ol\' Dirty Bastard, youknowhatimsayin?. I don\'t hide nothing back, I barely, I mean, I come from a family, man. Of poor welfare, youknowhatimsaying?. When I came out my mother\'s womb I was on welfare, youknowhatimsayin?. So so so it\'s like, you got to keep it real, nahwhatimean?. He had a heart of gold, intelligent soul from day one. Loud as the ferry. best friend was momma Cherry. Sweet lady, BK baby, she taught Dirty. How to cook, clean, singing the songs. Brooklyn Zoo. The first dude to say, "Yo, keep it real". Yeah, the lover, the father, the hustler, the rap professor. Now he with Allah, that\'s a blessing. [Interlude: Ol\' Dirty Bastard sample]. See, it\'s like, ok, where I come from. In my neighborhood, my people know me. Youknowhatimsaying? See, if I try to come any different. They ain\'t gon\' respect me no more. Youknowhatimsaying? Because they -- you know people. Got their thing about themselves, you know. If you come from the neighborhood, youknowhatimsaying. You couldn\'t, you couldn\'t get out the neighborhood. But you could never take the neighborhood out of the people. Youknowhatimsaying, but if you try to like jump and crossover. To the other side, people won\'t understand that, and they don\'t like that. That\'s why they don\'t be buying people music. See, we keeps it real, and we always gon\' keep it real.

Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot. Then you throw me off the green because I'm strictly hip-hop. I'll grab the tee, I'll tee off. I'll grab the golf clubs. I've got the timbos on my toes when I'm not on the green. I've got the custom made boots with the spikey things. I'm working on my driving cause I'm going pro.

My enemies is subdued, I'm a black belt. The moves I do, is how Bruce stick Kareem Abdul. Cuz, if Lil' Jon, can ice his cup. I top that shit, and ice my nuts. At 3 A.M., you like damn, who put the sun on the block. Is he crazy? Illuminate like the Son of God. And still pull up in the hooped out rented car.

S"The moonlight was robust but they couldn't see the beauty in it. Their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin. Discreet in crotches. underneath seats they tuck heat. To complete the mission they had no decision in. No longer do they use our light and dark hues to create the vision in our towns. But now they red and blue override our brown skin. We've been conditioned to let off them rounds when we see another color rag. Or, hear another brother brag about what set he claimin. Poverty, drugs and poor education should be the target. But we won't stay gamin that. We'll kill and maim another cat like there's no shame in that. Like there's fame in that. We hang out them car windows and bust them slugs. In the name of genocide in disguise, so we don't take blame for that. But if there's honor amongst you thieves in life. Then what the fuck you hidin for?. Recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin for. "

S'Something entirely fictitious and true. That creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways. Like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling. The dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss. I tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate. I know things you know and nothing you don\'t know. \'cept I saw something in the way of things. Something grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?. Was it so funny it followed me down the street. Greeting everybody like the good humor man. But an they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream. Me talking across people into the houses. And not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks. You could see them. But they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral. Looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction. And let them chant the number and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth. Remember Steppen Fetchit. Remember Steppen Fetchit how we laughed. I can see something in the way of our selves. I can see something in the way of our selves. That\'s why I say the things I do, you know it. But it\'s something else to you. Yearning for that nigga to come and give up his life. Standin\' there bein\' dissed and broke and troubled. My mistake is I kept sayin\' "that was proof God didn\'t exist". And you told me, "nah, it was proof that the devil do". But still, its like I see something I hear things. I saw words in the white boy\'s lying rag. Said he was gonna die poor and frustrated. That them dreams walk witch you \'cross town. S\'gonna die from over work. There\'s garbage on the street that\'s tellin\' you you ain\'t shit. And you almost believe it. Broke and mistaken all the time. You know some of the words but they ain\'t the right ones. Your cable back on but ain\'t nothin\' you can see. But I see something in the way of things. Something to make us stumble. Something get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness. I see something and feel something stalking us. Like an ugly thing floating at our back calling us names. You see it and hear it too. But you say it got a right to exist just like you and if God made it. But then we got to argue. Ain\'t it too bad y\'all said. Ain\'t it too bad, such a nice boy always kind to his motha. Always say good morning to everybody on his way to work. But that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad. I seen him walkin\' toward his house and he wasn\'t smiling. And he didn\'t even say hello. But I knew he\'d seen something. Something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will. And he kept marching faster and faster away from us. And never even muttered a word. Then the next day he was gone. And how the boys face looked that day just before they took him away. The face, your own face. Straining to get out from behind the glass. '

S'Hey, tequila to free the worm. Had his liver scuba suit up on the Sabbath. His personal pale rabbit. At the hole\'s end. her delicate mitten tipped. For sticking pissy liquor in him every day at six. Silly, predictability is a bitch. Fully patterned, had her awkwardly christening the small talk chalk board. She said, "This is less of a fixer-upper than my last bar.". "Funny, you\'re less of a fixer-upper than my last whore.". Crass is Similac to the milky wit of today\'s youths. Both chuckle out. Next couple on the house. Next couple on the couch. Swapping social coma rants. Phobias and soldier doubts, jokes and corporate mogul bans. Motor-mouths. Pussy plus yay; she hid in a broken toaster. And later wake neighbors over chemical flavor to fuck sickly. Tooth, nail beauty through the skin deep. An object at rest tends to remain at rest. And an object in motion tends to remain in motion. With the same speed... slow down. With the same speed... slow down. With the same speed... slow down. And in the same direction. Down... down... down.... Now the dizziness is similar to whimsy with a pretty twist. If pretty is a bidding war for meteors of iffy sniff. And cigarettes, and pills on a speaker. Silhouetted by the muted television and the rickety Venetians. Between tweaks, he sweeps at home depot and reads. Mostly biblical, but not cause he believed. But found the lexicon of Jesus-heavy literature fly. Feverishly sponged up the information high. Fade into the cradle of his same deck train wreck. She pet him with a mechanical tape deck play back. Plus, the depressing sum of the two combined pay checks. Stung less when little Debbie D-cup put her legs back. Drunk, put her on the business-end of his favorite couplet from. Corinthians. Sunk into the comforts of a kid again. Enough to share the stuff that truly interest him. This is where the vision of a shiny, happy Christmas end. Tipsy little princess wasn\'t listening, just yes-ing him. The more she fed him "yes", the more he fed her fresh barbiturates. Assuming it was them against the world into oblivion. But he was just a stupid simian that her live with him. Pirouetting madly on a mirror full of baggies. In the valley of the irritable Aggie. Any sincerity, miracles, or memory buried in the back-seat. By the hazardous materials was seriously gasping. Here he is in action trying to patch up the attraction. Figured he would win her back if he act in a common passion. Penned a couple chapters \'bout a sassy pair of magnets. With a cottage on a hill and a picket fence and a marriage. Never having gathered her rabid enthusiasm over language. Was fashioned around the aspirin in his cabinets. Asked her to read it expecting flattery after the fact. "You ain\'t shit man, your story\'s a joke. You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope.". Man she knows five chores, more coke, and all fours. Said, "Leave me on the floor and leave the dope by the door.". Bounced all shook up, she cook up aluminum. Consuming every skull and crossbones in the room. In under two minutes, he fuming with a flipped lid, stormed into the crib. And found her body on the tiles like, "No she didn\'t!", yes she did. Sis\' wiggle an index, if your limbs let. Or settle for a warm burgundy bubble out of her beak instead. '

Too short for a sport nigga. And I wrote this album without a care in the world. But the outcome as long as it?s an out pour of niggas who. Came out they downfall like an overblown round ball. before my sound off. Or maybe this music will inspire a future mountain mover or two. And if I ever rush more music out to you.

I\'m goin\' through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe. Why my Old Earth had so many seeds. But she\'s her own woman, and dude in me I respect that. Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor. Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV. Rockin each others pants to school wasn\'t easy. I guess mommy wasn\'t strong enough, she just went down. Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head. I didn\'t like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed. Seven o\'clock, pluckin\' roaches out the cereal box. watchin\' Saturday cartoons. Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no frills. In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel. And there was days I had to go to Tech\'s house with a note. Stating "Gloria can I borrow some food I\'m dead broke". So embarrasin\' I couldn\'t stand to knock on they door. My friends might be laughin\', I spent stamps in stores. Mommy where\'s the toilet paper, use the newspaper. Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats. Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me. But I remember this, moms would lick her finger tips. To wipe the coal out my eye before school wit her spit. Case worker had her runnin\' back to face to face. I caught a case, housin\' tried to throw us out of our place. Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky. And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?. [Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]. I sit and think about. All the times we did without, yeah. I always said I woudn\'t cry. When I saw tears in your eyes. I understand that daddy\'s not here now. But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah. All the things that I did from this to them. Oh from drugs to being there. Being down and out and I love you always. You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star. And them planets, that exist in my space. Like man woman and child. I remember them good ol\' days. Because see, that\'s the child I was. What made me the man I am today. See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh. You\'re never gonna make it where you\'re goin\', aheh. So take one stroll through your mind. And see what you will find. And you\'ll see a whole universe all over again. And again and again and again and again. '

But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart. When I began to do tours we lost contact. And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started. It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic. Addicted to her presence like a narcotic. Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic. That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded. Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated. Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic. I would begin to dial -. Her number but knowin it\'s been awhile it\'s hard to link. I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink. Fightin the feelin I\'m concealin apparently I first appealin. Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker. The essence of life is more than just mic\'s and puffin reefa. This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya. I\'m tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya. I said "Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana"?. He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma. When he began to break it down my mind start to wander. Response beyond somber incredible crushed. Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder. To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder. I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older. But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it\'s all chaotic. Most Melodic hypnotic. '

They're just vehicles you steer to ride other people's fears. Stars and Stripes are like nails and spikes. They're just tools that you use against the physical rules. Put down your weapon son (Slug talking). I heard a grip of little voices in a thousand heads. Calling me out of my rest to come and plow your steps. (Discretion and vision when you start the ignition). Cause any engine is highly delicate and what you got to say. Is irrelevant if you're talking for the hell of it. I smell some shit; check your sole, brotha, did you step in it?. The spokes bend and buckle (and the wheel collapses). There ain't no need to even ask whether or not you feel the Atmos. I'm peelin' back heads performing brain surgery. And sewing 'em back up (There, now you've heard of me). As I sit here with my head between my hands. Attention span focused on trying to read the plans. I travel like Avis. I feel as if I've been to hell and back and I ain't even been to Vegas. Pages and pages of notebooks dedicated. To separatin' snake skin and amputatin' fake lips. (Underestimated) But when you heard me, your masculinity went girly. And your whole crew broke out early. Moist, thats how we leave 'em rendered.

S'Lukewarm folgers; mold on his moonpie. Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies. Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning. My duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat. To Mom "It\'s me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half". She said "I\'ll keep you in my prayers," I said "I need to hide a body". She said "Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday". Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn\'t matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter. Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway?. Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats. Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past. Except it doesn\'t always work like that. Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt. Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn. I told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric;. You are healthy, you are special, you are present". Then I let them go. Oh.... You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions. I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards. In the mirror sweating pitchers; who\'s there: simian or lizard?. As it were there is a disappearing difference. In ambition and material;. Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol. Move as a godless heathen; black gums, tooth gone,. bootleg \'Yukon Cornelius\'. I\'m a... That\'s better, here we here we go. Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill. Got a little plot of land where authority isn\'t recognized. Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized. Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying. It is something he must handle on his own; the wind blown way, wanna win? Don\'t play. Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark. Where the grape vines climb a convenient barn. I told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted;. You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded". Then I let them go. Oh... I have been completely unable to maintain. Any semblance of relationship on any level. I have been a bastard to the people who have. Actively attempted to deliver me from peril. I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up. And lip that kissed me on the temple. I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition. That admits it wish its history disassembled. I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance. While skimming for a ministry to pretzel. I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish. That acted different when the bidding was essential. I have been a terrible communicator. Prone to isolation over sympathy for devils. I have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels. Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand. Where the low tide showcased a promised land. I told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive;. You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive". Then I let them go. Oh. (On and on and on and on...). '

And now it hurts to be around or converse with ya. And what?s worse is before this, I had worshiped you. Now war missiles hand guns and grenades. The walls I couldn't break em or take em apart with a tank. Now momma told me be careful who you love. G said just rap it up, these bitches actin up. And as for us, we was different though. Things have gotten difficult. Try to be Mr. perfect intercontinental, hold up. You spend your time with your friends all the time. And all that time with your friends put my momentum on decline. You changed with the season. You had a new clear heart. Guess I was Hiroshima. So now I need some Xanies, some Remy, and some reefer. So when this war is over I'm not PTSD'ing. But you know what got me wonderin'. I'm scared to lose love but even more scared to love again. [Seinfield Skit]. Yea, they do whatever they want, whenever they want. And nobody else can stop it. I'm catching myself depositing these feelings she withdraw from. And I ain't got the gall to tell my godzilla byebye. So I'm hurting. Me effort is apparent she not fertile. The anger I've adopted. The feelings been aborted. So now I press ignore if ever Cupid tried to call up. They call me better now. See when everything is stopped. And your loves in hindsight and you see everything its not. Notice everything it wasn't. Realizing why it shouldn't ever be again. Cause in the end its not about what you put in. Fuck kissing and hugging. They love pushing your buttons. New love is so beautiful. Time just makes it ugly. But fuck it I accept it. no longer will neglect it. If a period is late then I will mark it with a question. That mean I never trust em. And if you ever love them. Know that favorite girlfriends turn into crazy baby mommas. Just another product of this matrix. This maze I'm in amazes me at times. I just wanted to be at peace with you. And if I gotta settle for a piece of you. Then I gotta say peace to you. With all due respect I do respect you enough to expect. Effort is all I ask. If we gonna last more, I gotta ask for more. I'm sure we'll end up as our last or...past. We bash. We blast. We shoot. We lose. We pass.....war. "

And didn\'t see me grab the Plug Tune fame. As we go a little somethin\' like this. Look ma, no protection. Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monet. And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough. So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay. am an early bird but the feathers are black. So the apples that I catch are usually all worms. But it\'s a must to decipher one\'s queen. From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ. I maximize, my soul is the right size. I watch for the power to run out on the moon. (And that\'ll be sometime soon). Faker than a fist of kids. Speakin that they\'re black. When they\'re just niggas trying to be Greek. Or some tongues who lied. And said "We\'ll be natives to the end". Nowadays we don\'t even speak. I guess we got our own life to live. Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?. Every now and then I step to the now. For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool. Now I won\'t apologize for it. This is not a bunch of Bradys. But a bunch of black man\'s pride. I\'ve never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside. I\'ve always walked the right side of the road. If I wasn\'t making song I wouldn\'t be a thug selling drugs. But a man with a plan. And if I was a rug cleaner. Betcha Pos\'d have the cleanest rugs I am. I read the diction from the second page. Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink. So let me need ya to my ems go. I push the infinite and carry it. My carrier\'s the three over one. So my pluggins already know. I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun. And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore. I bring the element H with the 2. So ya owe me what\'s coming when I\'m raining on your new parade. t\'s just mind over matter. And what matters is. That the mind isn\'t guided by the punished shade. I keep the walking on the right side. But I won\'t judge the next who handles walking on the wrong. Cuz that\'s how he wants to be. No difference, see. I wanna be like the name of this song I am. I be the new generation of slaves. Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes. The deeds of a natural. Are seeds that are no longer planted. So the famine in the mind is strong. I stabilize many cableized viewers. So my occupation\'s known. But not why I occupy. And that is to bring the peace. Not in the flower but. the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am. '

Billion-dollar budget movie scene on big screens. Al Green is doing my themes. From off the Greatest Hits which is my favorite disc. I learned to handle bars on the mic. Before I handled bars on the bike, I hold it tight. Broken dreams smoking fiends lying on the roof. Some are nodding with the belts tied around they arms. Out cold, pipes still in they palms. Here\'s my Offering pass around collection plates. Stainless glass windows of ancient black Negroes on my casement. My visitors, thug niggas hopping out of spaceships. Word, had Armani spacesuits, holding two bad alien birds. Saying "Neek neek neek" translated means "where\'s the herb?". He fucked the green bitch, I took the blue one. Just came home from Mars. He was up in this bar where this lizard bitch was stripping. The scene turns like it\'s Claudine. James Earl Jones, hot combs over stoves. Dax hair grease, a rare piece of footage, hood clips. The score\'s done by the poor but the pure dreamers. Handwriting\'s on the project wall. Spray painted in the modern day Cuneiform. You might meet a crackhead that made it, to translate it. He can tell you who\'s fuckin\' with broads, and who related. But you gotta know the ghetto password, so he could say it. In the Hood we turn throwing up signs into a language. Riots, we gonna start \'em, fuck it, they got problems. Pour me some more crushed grapes in my cup, it\'s envy and lust. '

Could never be contained by a simple picture frame. might hear. spit. My talk is not as cheap. And my thoughts are not as deep. As the day I woke up to discover I lost my sheep.

Do like Beecher did to Shillinger and shit on your ass. See shit has changed ever since they killed Adebisi. Like sticking mirrors out between the bars, seeing the guards. Seem like everybody innocent, regardless of the charge. You face death, rape threats, and place bets on who getting laced next. Forever faceless, never waste breathe. Blowing out the candles that the wind already snuffed out. Police don't sweep to get the dust out. They want your name in the system. People listen: they got teenagers up in the line-up. To fill the new facility they built, they need the crime up. Please, the War on Drugs is really war on the youth. [Outro: Augustus Hill on ?Oz?]. Darkness. For three days straight.

So if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance. The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps. Maroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss.

Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation. And I walk like early man, freak a little witch hunt. Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma. The malformed oddities among sovereignty's normal. Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you. All I thought of was the cloven-hooved. And how they clip-clip-clop over the woven roofs. With a nose for commotion and stolen goods. Now tell me, what the fuck am I supposed to do?. In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight). We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate. (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). They're all-they're gonna want his milk money next. Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow. Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone. All the town sickly know the Coke machine as home. Where they sit and hope the Ovaltine that noble's drink is strong. Couples only roller rink with soul to kiss your chicken noodle. Before they wiggle mittens through the pillory to ridicule. And you can hear the iron maidens lock. Or see the town criers ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck. A is up early, ring and run thank you much. Document a little of that underbelly bang for buck. Hey I walk as the hype of the city gossip. Meaning every dumpster diver's gotta vomit up a comment like. Um you ain't shit, this ain't ill. This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still. This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build. Cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell. Babylon goggles, gawk for the galvatron coppers. I'll be shepherd when the whirlybirds deny the lepers doctors. The terrible metal hacking seasons. as ski up off a plastic d-cup. You'd think Charlie Brown was Weathermen. How I zig-zag around these yellow backs for peanuts. When the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you. You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose. "

Keep 'em all on that need to know. Tell 'em all that we're just cool. As far as me and you, we got a simple code. Spendin' nights, well that's optional. No telephones in the afternoon. I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'. Every time your ass in the mood. Sharin' thoughts when we share a room. Though we barely talk when we share a room.

Is that like the end of the world or something?. (Certainly not!). Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?. (I know!). I mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated. (It's almost stupid if we didn't!). It's moronic. (Absurd!). [Hook: SZA]. I'm not tryna pressure you.

For the water will engulf us if we do not dare to tread. So let's tread water'. Now one weary day I woke, my alarm said 'Plug time's up'. Filled my bath up with the water, gargled with my gargle cup. As I bathed I felt a presence, and I'm sort of ticklish. I looked down and then around and I heard. 'Hi! I'm Mr Fish. How do you do?. As for me. I'm in tip-top shape today, cause my water's clean. And no-one's menu says Fresh Fish Filet. See I look past all my worries, which is something you must do. Though you're fed up, throw your head up. With this advice from me to you.

S"Staring at a future in the creases of my hand. It reads like a final letter I?m leaving for my fam but. It?s written in language they will never understand. A late repentant. Never deviating from a plan. I drive by headed for the valley of the damned. The Wheels spin, I?m looking for a sacrificial lamb. Then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan. Was this a matter of flesh and blood. Yes it was. Does it matter who win and lose. Yes it does. It ain?t about the most blessed love. When you return to the essence. What is it back to the essence of?. Greatness I wasn't in the presence of. Cause you was fake and never measured up. You just a nigga on his regular. But how far am I ahead of ya. It just as easily coulda been me instead of ya. [Derrick Moore]. We gon? fight till we can?t fight no more. And when we can?t fight no more. We gon? lie down and bleed a while. We gon? get up. And fight some more. Want you say it with me. Repeat it after me when I say it. We gon? fight. Fuck getting fucked. Immaculate conception. Now what?s beef ain?t even a question. Calico kisses, cold blood and crime tape. Flirt with death, every night it?s a blind date. One night stand, payback's a bitch. Shit have you skinny dipping in a pool of your piss. Blood, sweat, and tears, broken teeth and spit. Put the barrel in your mouth. Blow the devil a kiss. Put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat. Daddy should?ve let me be a stain on the bed sheets. I?m one shot short of a Molotov cocktail. Kick in the door like welcome to my world. I?m an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit. Half of the time I'mma keep it one hundred. Don?t play chicken when I?m driving them crazy. Get hit in the wing thigh breast or drumstick. We like. "

S'Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what\'s delicate. Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it. There is a brain in the thicket tap circle. Cupping the port to accord it. Where the Ebenezer to Cratchit ratio tragic. A leader\'s deception connection. Wiper with a barn responds his friend. With an eye socket full of needles. And a will to die for nothing. I don\'t mind y\'all looking in. It\'s just watching Sin City steam slips under my skin. 2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment. Mastodon. The time vibe strapped to dignity my. And I\'m a tug dummy, hug the hungry. I\'m sick of the picker the litter soaking the spot lit. Ochre and sienna war paintings stain plague community. Await a straightened arrows a perfect circle has been fastened. To the blimp side buy in my grin and clusters. My own father\'s son is the holy ghost, suck that theology. High king for a day or peasant for a pleasant life. Blood on the easel and my eagle eyelid spots runaway pirates. Look, I despise squatters with a, oh, cry me a river. A quarter how\'d you afford that dog and sour dialogue. I put my hook in the pond. I put my worm in the hook. I put my trust in the worm. That he\'d bring me something to cook. I felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can. On my pole with a note from the worm attached that. Read, "Thanks for nothing asshole!". Simple parables of nature making character giddy. Doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and. I\'m a fence sitter. Harbored and charged my hate breed in a minute he\'s picket. Spitting stitches to fix the britches in the gaps. One night I broke in. Bridges give us traps and. Tried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps. And I\'m, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath. Making that classic mockery of every step. Oh, build me a home. Build me a home, please, with a light in the window. And a red front door and a picket fence. And a fire place and a sturdy frame. And we can sit and I\'ll tell you my name, build me home.... '

With the wood, where you drive your nails, but too hollow. Far from reality, with a slim chance of getting back. Even if you narrowly escape the hidden traps. Nothing but the driven raps written in my notebook. Inspired by the cap and the gown, that's on the coat hook. Prepare for the chemical rush, something new to cause. Your heart to bass, but it's tangable to touch. Associate with those who are consumed with beats. Produce fire, until they melt the room with heat. You know my ink lay all over the sheets, let us/letters gather around. And form words, everytime they meet. Allah Be a Born, Cee Divine, Equality. Father, then after that, there's the G-O-D. He or Her, I Islam, then Justice. King of Kingdom, Love, Hell or Right, we still exist. Master, Now in Cypher/O, Power's the Queen. Rule of Rulers, Self of Save, the Truth of the square, the same. Universe, Victory, Wisdom, Unknown/X, Why/Y. Zig Zag Zig, and now we're back home. I brought butter for the popcorn, dip for the chips. And ego for your trip, some scripts for you to flip. Corrections for mishaps, errors, or mistakes. Fly raps for beats,. bottom line. Shine's like a precious jewel, cut up in the workshop. Couldn't buy this hardware, so don't swipe your card there. One hit wonders, get a little shine like flashlights. A livewire, known as the dragon that spit fire. Verbal action, hot as the grease from deep fryers.

S"You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist. Is this business emotionally invested?. Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it. Love is war, sex is a weapon. The mind is a mine so watch where you're steppin'. Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream. Come to fruition in positions used to make steam. Feelings are just filling in this half-baked scene. To make x-rated into nc-17. Our love below so dro we most high. Then wears off when what we wear's on. Again I turn away when what we share's gone. So.... If this is not the hardest part. I wanna part. Before it gets too deep. If passion dies within routine. I'll come clean. Leave me be, baby. Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared. Could have been fearless and unprepared. Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared. Could have been fearless and unprepared. Looking Back. Under the twilight, and we living the Miller Highlife. La Petite Mort, my lady we bout to die twice. But it's hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction. Increased heart rate only confused my addiction. We wired for desire, dangers to ourselves. Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths. My muse, sleeps deep within time. I go to her for credit though I need to decline. It's easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime. I'm sorry it's just the way we designed. "

So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey. On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs. Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed. Got older, developed ways of grippin the steel. Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal. 1987 Reaganomics ever curious. Guayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on. Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on. Thinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin. To hell with just gettin by and economizin.

S"Yo, my men and my women. Don't forget about the deen, Sirat al-Mustaqeem. Yo, it's about a thing. If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air. And lick two shots in the atmosphere!. It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend. The one you let hit it and never called you again. 'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?. You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim. To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend. Like you wasn't down and you called him again?. Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him. If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again. Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian. A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn. Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in. Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?. Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend. Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again. You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine. Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem. Baby girl, respect is just a minimum. Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em. Now, Lauryn is only human. Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament. Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn. It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in. Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans. Fake nails done by Koreans. Come again. Guys you know you'd better watch out. Some girls, some girls are only about. That thing, that thing, that thing. That thing, that thing, that thing. The second verse is dedicated to the men. More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women. Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans. Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!). Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men. Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement. The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men. Need to take care of they three or four kids. And they face a court case when the child support late. Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men. The sneaky, silent men. The punk, domestic violence men. Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men. How you gonna win when you ain't right within? (x3). [Bridge]. Watch out, watch out. Look out, look out. "

S"In august of 2-0-0-1 I went crazy... This was originally not for public consumption. This was made for four people... four people that literally saved my life. They know who they are... And, uh... I mean, I could live to be a thousand years old and never re-pay them. I don't think this song would pay for them. But hopefully by putting it out, push the bank a little further... This ain't a burner for the whips (no it isn't). This ain't even Aesop Rock fly earthworm demeanor. My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz and I was born in Long Island, New York. Seventy Six, before Graham and after Chris.... In August of 2001 my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone scaffolding imploded. I kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling. To the cold hard concrete on near bodega trips. For cigarettes and soda. shook me to casper. Dizzy with a nausea chaser, motor sensory eraser. Gorophobe tunnel vision. guilt, self loathing arrangement. Rose rapidly outta bog I'd never fished in. Simple primitive self taught, easing of soul, mind and body. But the symptoms rejected my cave-man modus operandi. So now it's one fish belly up. Shrinks that get 250 an hour for awkward silence. And, I'd be lying if I said all of this. Made even the slightest fragment of sense to me. I don't know what happened, or what's still happening. I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity. JAIME. I killed the robots and I'm sorry. You're one of my best friends and yes I'd take that bullet for you. That's my word, which is about all I have left. TONY. KATHRYN. Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this. Chicago visits. a head full of broken pistons. RAIA. Am I a jack of all trades? No... I like to write songs though. Are they good? I dunno... Now my fuckin' crooked soul never faced a monster like the last few months. Ever in my whole life... I wish I could explain this better (I can't). But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive. So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you. Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness. I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement. Cause without y'all I may not have a life to offer, take it. I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures. For helping try to kill what made a mess of me.. I guess it is kind of funny when you look at it from a step back. How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures. Other men operate normally under. But I guess some times, when you can't breathe, there are people there. To breathe for you. I am lucky enough to have those people around me. Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt. "

S"We often got to look for the path. These problems are the good ones to have. Nobody want to struggle at home. Bass in his voice, trouble in her tone. What kind of couple makes a puzzle out of stone?. Chopping and popping all of the bubbles that are blown. Nobody want to be wrong. And once the line gets drawn across what we disagree upon. It could be the time bomb that we sleep on. It's just a little one, back and forth like a ping pong. Nobody wants an argument. You try to bargain as a friend. But it's hard to with a star offence against a smart defence. And the history you share is full of scars and dents. Nobody likes breaking up. When you hate the situation but you crave the touch. You might stay in the relationship for the simple sake of it. Because you know it's based in love. Nobody want to go to work. For some older jerk that doesn't know the dirt. That's embedded in the hearts of those that hurt. Monday through Friday, and Saturdays for bonus perks. Nobody befriends beast. Just to make ends meet and try to pay rent and eat. Spread sheets by the end of the week. He'd rather spread them sheets than try to get some sleep. Nobody want to lift a crate. That ain't living great, you want a kid and play. You should dip, escape, no two week notification. Show up late and quit today. Nobody wants an awful boss. That got you popping out the top of your mouth as if it's common talk. off the clock. And appreciate that fact that you've got a job. But somebody want that life you got. They think your boyfriend's nice or your wife is hot. They on your block looking at that home you bought. They'd move in today if that door wasn't locked. Nowadays you ought to watch your spot. Even with all the flaws of that boss you mock. You could still close your eyes and toss a rock. I bet you'd hit someone that'd love to cop your job. That's what I thought, of course you don't stop. You won't take the shot, you can't afford the loss. If you don't want to taste the sauce. Then put the plate down and take a walk. Drop, or move away from the pot. Cause every time you talk you complain a lot. Don't forget to count the balls y'all caught. Enjoy what you got before it all falls off. "

The niggas that was real and the niggas that was scared as fuck. That\'s why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few. You ain\'t really real, I can tell when I look at you. So ease off the trigger-talk, you ain?t killing shit. It?s not affecting me or the niggas that I\'m chilling with. I don?t believe the hype or buy woof tickets. Nigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen like a cricket. I guess that?s why we never kick it. A lot of niggas is soft and get tossed tryna fuck with the Likwit. How many niggas do you know like this?. Always claiming that they riding but they really turned bitch. It don?t make sense. Either you?re a soldier from the start. Or an actor with a record deal trying to play a part. It?s a shame, niggas in the rap game. Only for the money and the fame (extra large!). It?s a shame, niggas in the rap game. Only for the money and the fame (paparazzi). See, I don?t need no lights no cameras. Just action, god damn it. Never no superstar, I\'m more like a planet. So my composure is kept while others start to sweat. Emerging from the fog with my fucked up dialogue. Trying to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt. And niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck. Now that?s deep, how deep? It?s deeper than Atlantis. big bad Los Angeles. Dangerous, vandalous. Now how the fuck is you hard. Not being scared by the boulevard. I\'m pulling that card and saying "gin muthafucka!". Flowing like liquid: soak it in, muthafucka. I\'m breaking it down, my sounds surrounds like death. From the West, putting whole counties to the test. breaker 1-9 copy. Niggas smoke stress. pipe dreams. I made a cool half mil before I had a record deal. Therefore you look and stare like it?s magic. But too much of anything can make you a addict. Whenever devils be starting static, break out the automatic. Who dares to cross this path?. Yo, I do you like math. So on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with. Smoking blunts with I dispose of your punk shit. Once again, it?s the Likwidation crew, and I return for you, like this. '

I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this\'ll do. I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too". She said she understood then everything was kosher. I gave her a Lil\' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it\'s like that now. It\'s like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now.

All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above. Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up. I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive". It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes. I coulda died, time went on, I got grown. Rhyme got strong, mind got blown. I came back home. To find lil\' Sasha was gone. Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong. I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show. That I would one day see her standing in the front row. But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school. With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper. It\'s like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now.

And right around the same time. Started noticin\' girls, but they wouldn\'t pay him any mind. And if they ever did, he got nervous. You should of seen him practice on his hand for his first kiss. Even though he was too young to hunt and gather. Hungry puppy had to learn how to front and swagger. It didn\'t matter, it was all self-esteem. At sixteen, you only needed one on your team. And mom and dad was never getting back together. So he was on some baby, "We gonna make it last forever". Basically married right out of high school. Five years of gettin\' high and fightin\' at a drive-thru. When he hit twenty-one, they made a son. But on his twenty-second birthday, the relationship was done. Now he\'s got a best friend instead of a wife. But he feels like he stole the best years of her life. After that, it was one codependent to the next. A lotta love, a lotta hate and a little bit of great sex. Self-learning in between the self-loathing. Strangled in a cycle, can\'t feel yourself choking. Some of them would overlap, some of them would double-back. None of \'em deserved to be exposed to all the trouble that he posed. Strike one? Not even out of fear. He don\'t even do rough sex, you bite him and he\'s out of here. Make no mistake he puts the man in manipulate. And he\'s attracted to the women that reciprocate. Y\'all can kick karma \'til it\'s gettin\' late. Until Mama\'s little drama is the topic of the big debate. And now a days the confidence is off the page. Cause women are attracted to that clown on the stage. He\'s only in town for a handful of hours. But Rapunzel wanna come down. And dance in the flowers. Wanna make her smile? Wanna make her laugh?. Wanna make up for the mistakes in the past?. Wanna act like he doesn\'t know better. If payback\'s a bitch he\'ll be in debt forever. Insecure, impatient. Temporary gratification, self-validation. That\'s what its made of it\'s all true. And it\'s the only reason that he\'s even talkin\' to you. Who?. You can try to fix my broken wings. You can know all the words to the songs I sing. But you don\'t need to know what\'s wrong with me. Unless you think you gonna come home with me. [Hook x2]. '

S"Surf's Up. Most kingpin rappers is also undercover. Sleeping with the enemy on some under covers. Tide rolled in, bread so thin. Gotta keep corn on me like Thanksgiving. Still smoking, like the barrel of young ones. With big guns that will face grown men. Got guts 'till they see their stomach lining. I?m not fishing for compliments but keep a line in. Seeing the world like Jack with an axe. Peeking through the door towards the end of The Shining. Uhh! Robbing and rhyming is my drug. Not only the block but the microphone I hug. Tsunami flow, suckers act like they don?t know. But there will never be another MC like me 'till 5004. There will never be an MC like you 'till 5004? (Yup). I rap like none of these rappers on earth, I?m not your average Joe. Space age pimpin' first verse now they have to protect the ho. Altercations and drama, riding around with them Lamas. Growing up in the ghetto where kids sell dope to their mamas. Bullet shells echo, men dead in the alley. It took nine hours for the coroner to come and pick up the body. As the world burns let me turn to my incense. "

S'I can\'t figure out why I give a damn to what she wants. I don\'t understand the now before the then. Most of this garbage I write that these people seem to like. Is about you and how I let you infect my life. And if they got to know you, I doubt that they would see it. They\'d wonder what I showed you how you could leave it. A friend in Chicago said that I should stay persistent. If I stay around I\'m bound to break resistance. Fuck you Lucy for defining my existence. Fuck you and your differences. Ever since I was a young lad with a part-time dad. It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had. I studied my mother, I digested her pain. And vowed no women on my path would have to walk the same. Travel like sound across the fate ladder. I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter. And I travel with feel, so I can deal with touch. It\'s like that,. thank you very much, fuck you very much!. (Yes, yes it is).  everyone in his life would mistake it as love. Everyone in his life would mistake it as love. Everyone in his life would mistake it as love. (Yes, yes it is). And everyone in his life would mistake it as love. Everyone in his life would mistake it as love. Everyone in his life would mistake it as love. Fuck the \'What happened?\'. I got stuck. They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck. Used to walk with luck, used to hold her hand. Fell behind and played the role of a slower man. I want to stand on top of this mountain and yell. I want to wake up and break up this lake of hell. I feel like a bitch for letting. the sheet. twist me up. The last star-fighter was wounded, time to give it up. On a pick it up mission, kept it bitter. Gettin\' in a million memories just to forget her. The difficulty in keepin\' emotions controlled. Cookies for the road, took me by the soul. Hunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture. Gonna take it further. the hurt feels like murder. Interpret the eyes, read the lines on her face. The sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?. Fuck you Lucy for leaving me. Fuck you Lucy for not needing me. I wanna say fuck you because I still love you. No, I\'m not okay, and I don\'t know what to do. And everyone in his life would mistake it as love. Everyone in his life would mistake it as love. Everyone in his life would mistake it as love. (Yes, yes it is). And everyone in his life would mistake it as love. Do I sound mad? Well I guess I\'m a little pissed. Every action has a point, five points make a fist. You close em\', you swing em\', it\'s hurts when it hits. And the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits. I got an idea, you should get a tattoo that says warning. That\'s all, just a warning, so the potential victim can take a left. And save breath, and avoid you, sober and upset in the morning. I wanna scream, "Fuck you Lucy!". But the problem is I love you Lucy. So instead I\'mma finish my drink and have another. While you think about how you used to be my lover. (Yes, yes it is). It - leave - never - would - you - you - show - could - I - if. '

But we ain\'t gonna be beefing, no. I miss you at my recent show. I speak to CJ often and sometimes. I just want to speak you up. Yeah, hit you up. Or call you up, or send a text. Your new man got my respect. So if I do call it\'s just a check. Heard that you alright though. My nigga for life though. It\'s funny how this life go. We love for a while then a light goes. Took me a while just to write those. Pride, I had a fight so. I\'mma stop right there and I know you don\'t care. But I hope you got that bite, boo, ay. Yeah, tell me about the love of ours. "Contemplate", I wrote about her. We no longer close or nothing. That\'s why she ignore my flowers. And my call and my text. Spending her time with him I guess. I regret some shit I did. But darling, is y\'all intimate?. Who was better? I know I was. Don\'t you lie, don\'t blow my buzz. You ask me who I\'m stroking now. I say that the pool is closed. Can we stay broken up?. And all these pages, close them up. I hope we both do learn from this. So my next joint don\'t got to be so rough. Huh, got to get better with time. Relationships should never rewind. Better leave it all behind. Guess that means you can never be mine. Well, um, there\'s a but. Without your love it\'s cold as fuck. Life is a movie we both say "cut".

Relax kids,. black kids got a craving for Cris. leave the Mac with your Wis'. But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth. Spread Wu-ness. rule this, civilization's cursed. But luckily I'm born to be wild and then be out. Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out. Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid. Built like a steroid. pat down Dan Aykroyd. My seeds, grow with his seeds, marry his seeds. That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family. My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds.

One for the life, and two for death. Three damn strikes no chances left. E-40 and the C-L-I-C. we used to have to use. Sheets for curtains, socks for washtowels. I was happy as hell when my cousin gave me his hand-me-downs. This ain't no happy Shirley Temple realistic crap. This here is serious more Realistic than Radio Shack. Observe as I strike a nerve, reach out and touch my kind. I miss you spill some liquor main, who got some tissue. E'rybody wanna shoot em up bang bang. Way I was raised we had to knuckle up and throw them thangs. We got em up and you know I had to check em swell. Cuz if I ran home and didn't fight back my mom'd beat that tail. They said uh, they tryin ta, they tryin ta take away our weights. And uh, no more beef and pork just muslim books and fish fork. And laps around the yard with my Walkman bumpin this. Thought it was, till I got the Dear John letter. Been down for ten months and got a eight year stay. And I just found out she had her baby yesterday. Man ya out there ballin main can you drop a twomp up in my commisary. Uhh, my family thinks that I'm a thug homie. When you see my momma man give her a hug for me. And tell her. We used to kick it at the waterfront the whole Vallejo. Watchin the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del. That's what we did up under the bridge fools posted up. Choppin game conversatin gettin toast up. Them Click boys mobbin deep in cuts, actin meanest. Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong. One day soon I'll get another try, 1-Luv. "

Keep the funnel cake. I'm honey glaze in vitro. In the company of similar believers. Sleepless, who hear the walls breath and foam at the facial features. Now the yeast, a phoenix in the partially hydrogenated. Equal parts flour, faith, healing. Might replace your previously nominated Jesus. But only if you privy to the following secret of all secrets. Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back. With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat. Show up around 1 never get your God back. If you're just tuning in, walk into the light. Walk into the light. I boil oil too, not for scarfing. For CCs of Japanese innovation that screech into free parking. Purple heart and second chin that beseech him to squeeze the carbs into the motherboard. You can chew the Eucharist in cruller form. Locally a seedy danish underworld is bustling. Where jelly's not a celebrated stuffing, it's a puppet string. Pluck, nose for canola. 5 cow stomachs like a mime with a rope going nowhere. Fast, right hand of god on my shoulder, crows feet swollen, dopey. Combing apple fritters over with folk of opposing cultures. Baby sitter cop thief reverend, body glitter, botched c-section, bronze teeth. Each progressively more sequestered. Yet if threatened will defend the raisin bread as codefendants. Some lose religion or view it as superstition. You can tell a friend if you are down to kill them. Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back. With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat. Show up around 1 never get your God back. If you're just tuning in, walk into the light. Walk into the light. The fat boys are back, foam fingers over open arms. To feverishly reclaim their stomachs from golden jars. And stagger through the pulse ofthe gulch on a builder's dividends. Hiding high behind his guilty powdered-sugar fingerprints. Seething eventide fever, sidewalk feeling a little dicey. I'm snake-eye straight to the cakes icing. paper tiger. grace invaders. the first-name basis patron haters. Who compromise the pilot lights and flavors. Silent night, holy night. invite the pious out the pagan. Midnight kitchen doors un-caging the enablers like butchers in bloody aprons. Can I get a fucking amen?. AMEN, hazelnut raiders of the lost,. navigate consecutive pastries like stations of the cross. No name no dayjob. where it virgin mary toast by the loaf. Thanks bob. Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back. With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat. Show up around 1 never get your god back. If you're just tuning in, walk into the light. "

Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on. Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone. They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky. Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain\'t no lie. I\'ll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie. Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply. Now everybody say. Everyday I sit while my nigga be in school. Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool. Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone). Honey I\'m home but I\'m not married. Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated. And now I\'m sitting at the end of the month I just made it. Like you made the B team. and like your daddy\'s wife you making that coffee. You heard the A-T-L-iens, so back the hell up off me. Softly as if I played piano in the dark. Found a way to channel my anger now to embark. The world\'s a stage and everybody\'s got to play their part. God works in mysterious ways so when he starts. The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here. No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day. Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon.

S"I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste. The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch. Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux. Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks. Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed. It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants. Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants. Each one separately convinced. They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands. Delusion turned the communication to prison camp. You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause. There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost. I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts. Step out the tempest. A measure of what the spectrum involves. Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there. Don't need no help, all by myself. I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene. It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe. Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive. I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe. I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong. The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog. That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws. Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs. In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry. I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling. God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys. Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach. You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art. You can't be cooler than the corners. Where you source all your parts. The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks. We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark. Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there. [Sample: Sweet Tee - On The Smooth]. Don't need no help, all by myself. I view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose. Insecurities exploding in emotional code. When braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross. Corrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost. Before the hobby was a job he was a manager, hell. You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle. The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill. But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell. In a whistle and bell-o-rama, black mollies that dress up like piranha. It's not even compelling melodrama. It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga. I'm very voluntarily persona non grata. This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed. I'm offin' coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen. Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means. Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there. "

Hollywood Sambos and jokes just like Martin. I'm the type of nigga that belong in a war. With a mic and a cord, to hold your head with a sword. They shall be floored when the claps applaud. If this a point of life, one I can't afford. Then I have to get sheist and I deal in fraud. Now back to the topic of the rap philosopher. With more drama than a soap opera. Who stops the propaganda, the hot block commander. Putting a halt to all the backtalk and slander. Warn every challenger about the silencer. Muzzle in your mouth for the days that's on the calendar. I'm from the valley of the heavy-heads. Watch the ghetto pre-medical. Undergrads and steady red faces of stone. Eyes are crevices, life like a double negative. Philly criminal. I rhyme my dirt, Tariq already did. Building this Fifth foundation in the wilderness. entrance. Cypher slaughterer, my mic slapping you senseless. Defenseless, niggas never moving me inches. The beat Fifth, invisi-ble in the trenches. Aficianado. awesome hip-hop drug problem. Fuck stardom, and chickens up in. Gotham. Poltergeist, slit or choke the mic 'til it scream to me.

Then do the shit that make the bitches act bad. See this moment is addictive motherfucker. How I kill shit, they say, "he a vindictive motherfucker".

When they come and see the movie and they sit. They would come to witness it, I was the greatest in the flick. This movie has been brought to you by The Conglomerate. Uncle L, talk to \'em!. Ladies love me, I?m on my Breezy. Encore, L, future of the funk. Without my stamp on it, how this joint gonna bump?. Let them taste the vintage, they want a free lunch.

More green behind me, the fake gold fronts. I ain?t drop a verse in like 36 months. All I see BS, y\'all need to quick stunt. Damn, right, it\'s like you Midas when you touch. Your career\'s like a hymen: once it\'s gone, you\'re fucked. Now you know it?s impossible to stop me now, right?. You see I?m back to yoke up the game in a chokehold. Put you to shame like the barrel was engraved in your nose hole. You gonna bounce to the next groove: I\'m back bitch. Better get to rethinking your best move. Money to get, beating the pavement, gotta go. Where passports and visas and bitches waiting in Monaco. As I return to handle my biz. You know exactly what it is. '

S"dock at my porch. Time is of no essence, the presence becomes presents. Peasants become pheasants and soar past acceptance. Current currencies worthless, fodder for feeding purses. With iron clad words I solder together verses. I?m trippin like I?m eatin? the fungi. Leaving me cornered like the puss that crusts in ones eye. There's no light, just never ending night. And the weather's like a hurricane when land is in its sight. The sand within my hourglass could vanish any moment. And I'm trying to read the signs within the symbols and the omens. From the motions of the sea, to the color of the dark. This ocean of my dreams was more than cover for the sharks. Recovering these parts is like discovering my art. I wonder as I wander through my heart. Cus it starts a dream defferred. A clipped wing on a white dove. Seems absurd, a smudge on a white glove. Not seen nor heard like screams from the night's lungs. Cling to words so much that you won't budge. Fiends in herds who yearn for the white crumbs. Getting high like the city sky when it lights up. Thats what the night does. It hits your mind with the right stuff. To keep you blind with a slight buzz. The mind is like a puzzle that could never be completed. We scuffle through it's pieces, strugglin for peace it's. Hard for us to sleep and even harder to awake. The image in my mirror?s gettin harder to relate. I see me harbouring my hate and bartering with grace. But I couldn't be farther from my faith, or my face. Through this waste of my mind, may I find direction. I'm a waste of my time if I don't find it's lessons. So all welcome to this generous helping of self reflection. Night thoughts brought to life with incandescence. As the world twirls on the tip of our index. Staring into space one?s vision is endless. But glaring at the ground you can see where the end is. So just close pupils and be pupils and listen. The headset?s your desk the test is what?s missin. Disect these notes of quotes of keys written. "

Fight for it like there's never gonna be more. You get mad like your middle name desperate. Beat my chisel, leave my initials. Not only are we bitter but we're brittle. Go roll your eyeballs, toot your own whistle. "

Doin\' it below the radar, we doin\' it stealth. Doin\' it again for Illadelph, yo, who else?. We goin\' do it again!. Ayo I\'m on my job, see my eyes focused where the prize be. Even though they tried to rob me and sabotage the spot. Just like \'Pac when they got him in the lobby. Try to tax and fine me like Ronald Isley. P-5-D is who the repertoire be. Doin\' it again just like Poitier and Cosby. I\'m like Martin Luther King, you like Rodney. The difference is I give it everything inside me. Dear diary, the fans still swear by me.

Yo, you must be out your fuckin mind. Then I'm gonna hit you, wit that. Shit that's sure to make your dome crack. Watch me knock you down.

There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang. Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same. Peg leg navigate him starboard to port. By the nautical starry night yelling "The harbor is yours!". And you should tell them where you situate the gold. That is unless you\'d like a vacation with Davy J-J-J-Jones. Like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank. Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs. And while the shiny spoils piled higher every year. He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer. Ten summers prior on a night like this. Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west. Swore it blew him a kiss. When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a. F-f-f-fish. "What the heck!" frazzled, his telescope shattered. Gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder. To deck. circled the vessel 360 swiftly. Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey. Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar. He\'ll be the laughing stock of the Barbary Coast War. Like this dude either got two glass eyes. Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side. Now he knew what he saw. But had to prove he was raw. So he raped and he pillaged and. And he feud and he brawled. Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke. And vowed to always find her though he never told his cutthroats. Meanwhile, back in the now, got a brand new skeleton crew. On the move out when they aren\'t manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow. They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth. Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease. Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed. And he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat. Until his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map. One look down and lept off the dock. See if you can guess where X marked the spot. The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave. Only one mile from where he\'d seen the mer-mer-mer-maid. Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much. Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched. But see the vitamin deficiency was strong. So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog. Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand. Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand. And nary a high tide so grand as the one that put. The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land. I wish I could tell you that it ended happy. Pretend like his bones weren\'t practically snapping. Pretend like her gills didn\'t dry up and suffer. But that\'s a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water. No lie, scout\'s honor, got a million more. From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores. Before your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails. Remember dead men tell no t-t-t-tales. '

S"Everything isn't a predictable occurrence. If you've experienced everything except a purpose. Life sessions aren't lessons that can be simply taught. You gotta feel the matter. Build the data. You gotta strengthen self or your shield will shatter. In the field, we choose to scatter like lice. Instead of coming together and keeping it tight. It's hard to be alone, deep in the night. I try to avoid the dark life and be seeking the light. But so many times I fall in between the lines. Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine. If you base your life on wasted nights with no faith in sight. You might as well freebase on pipes. I've fallen down but I got up friend. Fell twice. Three times. Got up again and again. And again, it's nobodies but my fault it didn't end. You only don't win when you give in. I put on my body armor and remain the calmest. Being peaceful at heart helps me see through the dark. Like dogs barkin' it's hard for evil people to start bullshit. With a literally cool kid whose only form of battlin' is through music. If you hold yourself tight you can't lose it. Life or death, it's up to you who you cruise with. Exercise knowledge to increase your wealth. If you know yourself you'll be shown your wealth. Sometimes I ask myself a question. Is my lack of inner reflection. Some type of indication of what state my life is in?. They keep piping in elevator music. Sappy and happy as hell with foo foo shit. When I reflect back and recollect that. I was born into the state of walking slumber. Taught numbers, realize I'm dirt poor. It hurts more now that I'm older. Showered in water much colder than this. My third eye remains sightless. When the night hits. Can't help but lie awake. Contemplate fights with vice grips. "

S'Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid. Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage. 9 weeks awesome. Hides in a slipper. Look in her eye like she might be a wizard. Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot, she got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box. And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox. Swap 20 on the spot and cop the warlock. Back at the haunt, found god in the hamper. Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther. Good around misery and golden era samplers. Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers. Bet, more than a pet to worship, it\'s an MD recommended sense of purpose. Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria. Soon to be hailed, the greatest of all warriors. Hey Kirby. What you doing Kirby. What you doing there. I\'m not takin\' shorts. Why\'d you eat that leaf. Homie don\'t fetch, only woke to stretch. Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish. Skittish in the company of stranger danger. Otherwise, chase draw strings, tails and lasers. In a steel cage match with a maze of cables. Brazen, game-face based on Azazel. Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix. Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick. [slurp]: Thanks Kirbs, looking like a milli. Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly. Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment. Never lands on her feet though, I think she\'s broken. Mouser in training, nap on the toaster. Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker. 15 years taking prescriptions. Now a shrink like, "Ionno, maybe get a kitten". '

S'I\'ll still see something that reminds me of her. I got so used to her that without her my mind is a blur. She found somebody quick. I won\'t find another for a while. She was about to be my wife and mother of my child. It\'s crazy how you can have your life arranged. And the day you get engaged you notice she\'s acting strange. Like everything\'s changed and suddenly you don\'t trust her just the same. Then you find out some other man\'s been fuckin out her brains. That\'s when your heart starts to feel the pain. So much that you can feel it in your veins and you can\'t forget her name. That\'s when you Literally go insane. And you feel like you\'re so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says. Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today". Crackled on the speakers. Trickle down the sleepy subway train. I\'ll never understand how a girl can say she loves a man. And turn around and have sex with another man. I would have much rather been robbed for a hundred grand. Than to get interrupted and get a call that she\'s touching hands. With another man. Oh God! Another man!. I can\'t even cry. My tears been dry. That\'s why it\'s thundering. Hard out tonight and it\'s dark and it\'s cold. Cause the angels can hear me cry, and it\'s all in my soul. And all of them know I\'ve never felt this pain in my past. And it\'s ironic the first place we made love\'s the same as the last. In the shower .... that\'s why I put the rain with her name. And my power to trust someone again has faded away. Other girls want me? Tell em it looks like rain today. I wallow in my sorrow, smoke, and watch tapes that we made. And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades. The day I almost gave up everything that I gained. It\'s crazy how you can have your life arranged. And the day you get engaged you notice she\'s acting strange. Like everything\'s changed and suddenly it\'s on tape and you crumble. Cause you notice on the tape she doesn\'t kiss you, she just fucks you. That\'s when your heart starts to feel the pain. So much that you can feel it in your veins and you can\'t forget her name. That\'s when you Literally go insane. And you feel like you\'re so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says. '

S'At least I think was here asleep. Is it possible? Conceivable?. That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berserk?. In slid rhythm, fed a cycle bound by dilemma, debt, and vendetta. And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand. Contestants get the New York home game with real life shoot \'em up-action. Thug, vagrant, yuppie and art freak game piece all included. I told this cat the Earth was flat, he walked \'till his beard grew. Long enough to strangle himself for being stupid. It\'s bric-a-brac novelties, spliced with that six pack odyssey. Godspeed, tequila worm future, be concerned. My feelers spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings. While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings. I\'m a never give, I\'m juiced off projection. I\'m stubborn as a thousand born-agains avoiding questions. From the alpha to the zed, I bait this data for my pledge. To bathe a traitor of the twice forgotten favors that he bled. And not a creature stirred. It reeks of subway metal,. bevel edged journalist chin-on-fist shenanigans. Re-coin mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room. Mummified mannequins with future clenched adamant. And skeleton in cabinet. This amalgam circus got a ring of fire. Just big enough to shove my purpose in the circle. I\'m known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew. Release the hounds. To see which one could track your trail and serve you, sucker. I lay the law down upon its belly while my foot. Dug in between the 3rd and 4th disc yelling "Break yo\' self!". I finally actualized data commission. Past penny tip jar donation arrangement, but a far fetch from stability. Took a hard pledge early on. Blood donor to drum dozer, plowing the metronome, home. Blown caddy-cornered to cockeyed sound booster. Sensationally seismograph. Stabbing away on stone tablet to sketch a grouchy future. I drifted out the main spelunking unit with. watered down. Sample of cancelled development,. courtesy America. Land of the freebase. home of the triplicate grill character. My sorta sideways tilt caught pinball blinker. and citizens 1-x. Weren\'t steadied for this leaning grievance. with dilapidated winter jacket. I rock a crooked lid piece and sweat a bit. to make my wookie ends meet. Pacifist willing to step into a friend\'s beef if needed. Wing clipper out hierarchy. Passionate while they whine on some "Daddy\'s gonna kill Ralphie" shit. Suck the proverbial silver spoon \'till their parents quit apparently. Parasol spinning casually like. "I\'m an artist, please don\'t laugh at me". OK, time to buckle the fuck down. Solder your wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin. You could catch the memoir in several dimensions. The joy-of-life logic don\'t employ the spite process. Hence your plight botches.

Chris and Graham hate ?em too but advocate a braver chew invented for the code red, cola chaser, nose held, gulp!. Moments later 2 have been released. Leaving me the legroom and the legume police. Going "freeze, you with the pretzeled arms. Send your fabricated nausea my best regards. And know this kitchen as a prison ?til the pea pods die. I could sit here all night". So could I.

Still out-mule any last strafing watchmen. ?Til the lord taketh waiting as an option. Less like toes in a tide pool. More like, left, right, poached from notable giant Kaiju. Fat neck, fine tooth, rock and lean, yelling. "this ends now eat the god damn beans!" ah!. Hangdog mouth talk slang wrong and. that there\'s flatware exhumed by a crane arm. Time for some action. Stab one ripe for a swipe and extraction. Brined in malpractice. Carried to the cavernous yap and obliged access. If only in compliance with a deep-fried fascist, peep. Literally bite down once. And my tongue get a flooding from my uninvited guts. Pointer finger plug a hole in the dam. Ma notice, "ok gross, blowfish, dinner\'s over, go spit", pop call "bullshit".

Because late at night, the bad don\'t seem so wrong. Nightfall is curtain call for underhanded theatrics. Slugs travel through gun barrels. From hands that had practice. While rapist take the darkness. And make alleys they mattress. Jonesin\' junkies twitchin among hookers with coochies itchin. Spreadin disease, spreadin they knees in different positions. In the abyss is children that get lost in the mix. Gunned down for fresh kicks or oppostie colored fits. Its demons brewed lewd manners behind tints. People sitting in position to help with distorted views. Only experience doses of night that\'s on the news. Or BET showing the glamour without the blues. Or MTV helping you pick out Jessica\'s shoes. Just construes how you\'re living, confusing your vision. Nights a politician because only the truth is what\'s missing. Dirty cops fight crime with dirtier ammunition. The night\'s salivating waiting for me to finish spittin. When them lights low and ain\'t no night glow from the moon. Scoundrels run towns, no hounds to hunt them down. Keep your sight low and get your life stole by some goons. Swindlers injure you, a criminal\'s heart\'s miniature. Men in the dark paint sinister art in the park. Son of the morning star? Stringing hearts like a harp. Playing melodies of jealousy, felonies strummed by. Hell and it\'s philharmonic, bewitching our young guys. "Whats Gone Wrong?". We no longer seek light to give us power. That voice gets hushed by the rush of the Witching Hour. The touch of the wicked cowards that lurk in the dusk. In even-tide, heathens rise, searching for bucks. Anonymous and corrupt, assure obscurity. In a spell under it\'s viel, an impure security. We love it in our spirits cause we\'re suckers for lust. Most even fuck in it, we\'re too ashamed to be just. '

Tough luck, right before I was about to give up. I passed out emotionally bankrupt. In the dead vegetation it was dark brown red like menstruation. I couldn\'t eat it despite the temptation. I was hungry and impatient. I stopped payment, they botched my facelift operation. Nip and tuck, livin\' it up. DAMN! "Why you still spittin\' \'Bus?". "Cause you don\'t listen to my lyrics enough". At night from a satellite\'s view the city\'s the heart. The red and white blood cells are the lights on cars. From that distance, look down and observe my lyrics.

Buy the album; get a $50 dollar rebate, before it\'s too late. 2012 is the bill due date. Solar activity is gettin\' stronger now. I evolved from clay and statue, from statue to flesh.

S"Illuminati nah. I dropped my britches down. I will illuminate the sky, full moon though. June coming,. due weather, El Diablo. But always seven hallelujas when I meet my mama. I ain't with the talking, I call them seven digits. How they come up quicker than prisoners getting conjugal visits. As God as my witness I'mma talk to these niggas. It's not a problem, partner, get you some guap, but they listen. And all of us gifted, nigga, all of us gifted. I just toss syllables about as hard as Harvard admission. Know that lyric is that Zuckerberg though. Is that fuck the world riding algorithm with that flow. About a half a ticket sold. glad to give you niggas hope. Still it's hardly number one like I am passing kidney stones. Hold up, now it's coming to subliminals. Cause all their women feel me leaving phlegm upon my genitals. Getting dollars. don't get shot up, you caught up Interscope. They say the music business can lure a 100% of you, that's what's up. Wonder why I'm stingy with love. I'd rather give up a kidney, a bone marrow than trust. Need me some girls, that's word to Lena and Judd, I'm high. [Hook: Fun]. And, for once there is nothing up my sleeve. Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me. I used to run at first sight of the sun. Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up. "

The sun that didn't shine. I blame it on the wind and the trees. I blame it on the nights I never was in love. I blame it on the times that could not be. But my heart blames it on me. [Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]. You see I loved hard once. But the love wasn't returned. I found out the man I'd die for. He wasn't even concerned. My heart must've died a thousand deaths. Compared myself to Toni Braxton. Thought I'd never catch my breath. Pain suppressed. Will lead to cardiac arrest. "

S'Back in the days was kinda crazy, kid I started out with nothin\'. Wasn\'t livin\' like Thanksgiving, I was turkey without the stuffin\'. Say mama caught the drama, she would bleed tryin to feed 4 mouths. Wasn\'t rockin\' Girbauds, I barely had clothes, and when it snowed. And temperatures droppin\' below zero, you know I froze. No CD\'s, a black and white TV, a seat is a rubber tire. With a hanger for the antenna, turned channels with some pliers. Had nothin\' in my cabinet, but cans of Raid. I\'m knockin\' on my neighbor\'s door. To borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid. I wasn\'t freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped, I\'m trippin\'. Cause my winter coat got lost buttons. And zippers that wouldn\'t stay zipped. Walkin\' the streets, with the weak sneaks on my feet. And the freaks wouldn\'t speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek. So much for gettin\' humped from the stunts, I always struck out. The ones you like says take a hike if you can?t pull a buck out. So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls. Straight up baby, I\'m blowin\' up in the world. [Verse 2]. It seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back. "Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or. hit the road Jack. Black, I don\'t disown her, I\'m just a kid from Corona. G.E.D. diploma. with more ribs showin\' than Tony Roma\'s. In order to get straight, I gots ta to make a muscle. Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle. Standin\' down on the corner slangin\' fat rocks to bottles. With the black tops,. for cops got my shorty watchin\' my back Hobbes. Makin\' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton & gucci. Hoochies callin\' me boochi, while they smooch me, givin\' up the coochie. Some started jellin\' and tellin\' police just cause I was swellin\'. Hangin\' out on the corner playin\' cee-lo, rollin\' for half a kilo. Yo you\'ll never see G-low a-goin below. Yeah, straight gettin\' fortunate,  as long as fiends was torchin\' it. It started gettin\' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin\' it. But luckily I made out before the coppers could freeze me and diss me. Cause business is drugs is gettin\' too risky. So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch tramps diamonds and pearls. DJ Polo. "It\'s a Demo". sportin\' gold chains and rings. Clockin\' money and fame, nothin\' changed, I\'m still the same. And grinnin\' cause I was winnin\' in this game from the beginning. The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill. And here\'s a new cut, for pooh-butt, rappers hangin\' from off my. Two nuts. So peep Kool G. Rap, don\'t sleep, money unless it\'s witcha girl. '

S'Lost generation,. fast paced nation. World population confront their frustration. The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken. It\'s all contractual and about money makin. Pretend-to-be cats don\'t seem to know they limitation. Exact replication and false representation. You wanna be a man, then stand your own. To MC requires skills, I demand some shown. I let the frauds keep frontin. And roam like a cellular phone far from home. Giving crowds what they wantin. Official hip-hop consumption, the 5th thumpin. Keeping your party jumping with an original somethin. Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional. No imagination, excuse for perpetration. My man came over and said: "Yo we thought we heard you". Joke\'s on you; you heard a biting-ass crew but um. Aiyyo, it\'s funny when I see some rap niggas do to make it. A few\'ll blow up, or go as far as they can take it. My nine to five, is just to hit ya get the party live. I\'m Black Thought, used to rap for sport. Now the rhyme saying rent paying life support. It\'s various crews that try to touch me. Around the world crowds love me, from doing tours. Recipient of applause from all of you and yours. Creator of original sounds to send to stores. You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores. Infinitely go against the grain, that\'s why my motto\'s to. Living the life of limos and lights. Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights. Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks. And my mental thick they hit my head like brick. As I embark on a mission welcoming to the dark. When I first spark the arts, when the listening start. Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside. My style fortified by all of Philadelphi. Mentality undetectable by the naked eye. "I want it made" like Ed. Then after that, I\'m putting on my cousin Hamed. We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred. And discover, my level is that of no other. And Roots crew reign official and true while I\'m continuing to. '

It was strictly all about about magnificent rhyme clout. The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without. Now it's wigs pushed back. my goal is to.

They say that karats help your vision. But somehow it made them listen. No this ain't silver, this is my dilemma. Arrogant when I finish. I came from humble beginnings. So it's nothing to finish.

Shoutout to Maybach Music,. my logic is getting money. Spitting something real, let the people know, and still love it. Shady flow: Johnny Cage,. chain flow: Johnny Dang. Ben Baller,. six bottles, talk with such expensive slang. I got geechi on 'em, now they notice a nigga. So who that chain change? It ain't both of us nigga.

It was never filmed, therefore never seen. I wrote the script, I was sipping lean. Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam. This thing of ours. It's so mafioso. This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper. They don?t rap for a reason, this is rather convenient. Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing. Ain't even 5?11?, what the fuck you guys scared of. And I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards. Getting up in they mental, get ?em outta their garments. Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama. Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us. natty dread, got no barber. I see Feds, I go that way, that DMV shit taught us. When you young and you black, they see you as a target. So before them Foamposites get ya lawyer in order. The don of all dons, since y'all wanna call me something. All of a sudden, niggas ball and stunting. Y'all just started pulling on Havanas. A don is one who accept things he cannot change. Gold medallion over my son chest, he?ll hold it down when I sunset. What does death mean to me?. I?m just a spirit, let's get one thing clear. Everything segues into each other. One thing is just an extension of the other.

S'Grab a bidi and light it. Back off into the night and then I start to get frightened. Thinking "Damn! My whole life I was just a dreamer. I never got to put on a show in a packed arena. I wanted to go on Rap City and act witty. But all I ever did was put up with hoes who act shitty. What a wack pity! Was I choosin a road. That didn\'t get me there in time and now we losin our globe?. Hold up I\'m losin control. Think realistically on it. What could fuck up a planet in one day without warning?. And even if the world does end and I can be mad at guys. Cause life coulda been much worse. At least I\'m satisfied. At least my dad\'s alive married to my mother. I have a sister and friends that I could call my brothers. At least I have life. Some people, their life was stolen. Set up for a crime and behind bars is where they hold em. We got kids killin kids cause Earth is cold. Women using abortions as a form of birth control. It hurts the soul and leaves a scar on your conscience. But it\'s a blessing that I made it through this nonsense. So even if this will be my last night. At least when it\'s over I\'ll be doin alright.... 5th, 99, three years later and change. The World Trades frame got struck by planes. Looking like God unleashed his fury and rained flames. Exchanged pain for how America came to fame. Cluthing my brain, my sense of security changed. Usually confidence was pure in me, now fear in my veins. Said "any of this shit could brang nuclear weapons. ...any of this shit could end at any second". If the Commander in Chief couldn\'t insure our protection. That\'s no more additions to my memory\'s collection. Missing me and my girls matrimonial connection. No child and videotapin\' her first steppings. Or growing old and teaching grandchildren lifes lessons. But thankfully I got saved during them church sessions. So I thank God for earth\'s blessings... health. Not alot of wealth, but alot of peace within my self. Not a whole lot of forgotten pieces upon the shelf. Disclipline from loving parents, though they raised me. By the belt. (life) took it for granted. (christ) hope he could stand it. The devil was eating me alive but I climbed out of that sandwich. Now possibly on the verge of having everything vanish. Feeling as if I didn\'t do anything as I planned it. Like I was trying to live my life right, but somebody panned it. But I still had love, when down helping hands lifted. Me up, outta the mud, outta the muck. And outta the dark and attitude when I didn\'t give a fuck. From them days in the park, alone, drinking gin by the cup. Through an exitless maze, wandering and constantly stuck. The blessings were always there, I just chose to ignore them. Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them. Wasn\'t selfish with them, trying to stretch and contort them. And didn\'t let the world get to them first and distort them. So as I.. kick back and ponder on armeggedon. And I... spit raps about where my life could\'ve been headin\'. I.. admit that.. I do have a wonderful life. So if this night was my last, i\'ll be doin\' alright. '

S'Teething I\'m marking a beast sheep. Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a "v". Smores over warm helvetica brown proper. For the odd God or monster, propped to teleprompter. Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel. Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia. Usually the shooter community chew the corpse. But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours. Day of the dead, play the ledge closely. Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey. Dope the gonzo I\'ve always felt choked socially. Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies. Earth rised, divided by fighting tribes. All we do is watch \'em waddle back and forth lighting fires. Detonator, wire cutter, pliers. Two cities enter, one is broken up in tiny tiles. And I won?t pose arm in the heart of the lion?s throat. For a photographic token of my primordial growth. You parade around and kill, so damn proud. Like a flatline fetish, had it\'s feathers fanned out. War taught him symmetry, skipped into it gingerly. Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry. Hell\'s bells every which way the the wind blows. So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go. Another dark night, another not alright. Another bad ritual, more botched surgery. Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently. Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery". Vicinity wander, claim no soul. Never let an anchor drop. Never had a home, never talk to strangers. Never trust a friend. This is the life and the life will not end. Next time think. 39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks.... Raise your drinks. 39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks. We\'re not concerned with the community aloofness. Dude, we\'re animals, we just go where the most food is. Lower the toast, most formal etiquette is useless. Truth is you\'re equally expendable. if spoon-fed. Money is cool, I\'m only human. But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded. Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is. Bullets don\'t take bribes stupid, they shoot shit. Calicos tread around the rabbit hole. Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows. Piss warm sugar water. what a summer canteen. Plus burned rubber like "green is the new green". Rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex. Rodeo commotion, I\'m open to see what culminates. Bougie on the right, left rep rebel force. Both say the feud will prove the parking lot was never yours. Black top pebble wars. Soldiers molded where the jones?s every grown-up. Eighty-five rattle-trap parked and fancy. You could swear he was stepping out of Comanche, antsy. Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine. And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in. Both know the totem camaraderie. Token of equality, they post it horizontally. Crown the golden loading dock. they crawl to lodge the colony. Half-mast flags. And sleep the sleep of the just ready on the left. Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect. With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters. On the day your name became "This Motherfucker?". '

Your vocal chord is fraudulent, and not the true porcelain. I bring the fire, earth, and the source of wind. The force of sin will endorse the pen. We all search for sanity, but I think that it was lost again. Next I'm in the womb like a placenta. Strategic, I bet y'all niggas can't believe this. I read you like a whole avenue that's filled with meters. Punks, fuck your back talk, I watch how niggas cat-walk. Over my pit of venom and send em to the asphault. For inquisitives, who wanna try to test me. What protects me, will make you shake like epilipsy. Stimulate more than Ecstasy y'all niggas check my recipe. excuse the greed don't want a mill'. I want a zillion - stacks of Franklins to the ceiling. Even when in the cut niggas can't cut they anxiety. cause I can't stand. Courts or tennis, my pigmentation is the menace.

S'That\'s sixteen uncut direct from the cult. Head on assault, the result death by the bulk. In a vault, they spoke about the average loss per mission. That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision. Like a plane crash from a bomb blast. Special broadcast, slot time with con cash. They kept the jury quiet and now the riot will form. While satanic man now hang in his dorm. I swing on you fake radio personalities. Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties. And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play. But instantly slap ya five like it\'s Palm Sunday. I fashion the first tool, from the elements the Earth use. And built it to a complex network of communications. You\'re up against a hopeless situation. I screen every vehicle from enemy observation. Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror. Increase the fog significantly, change the era. Check my wind pattern, it\'s heading west. Success is freedom but failure can mean death. Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble. Permanent damage caused by the W. Now who cowardly urge you to merge through. The Sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel. It\'s a countless amount of emcees I saved. And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave. Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?. It seems our will is worthless, like we\'re. pawns beneath the sky. Fates erased by reason and passion\'s just a whim. Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in. Love and hatred, moments most sacred. Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis. Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with. Guns we played with, niggas I relate with. We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed. Sent out secretly to take my head. I laid back and meditate to the words they said. Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads. Had a friend tell my family I was dead. Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf. Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me. Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me. I\'m like Solomon, spoke bluntly. told the world, "I\'m black and comely". Howls from the grave haunt me. the smell of death\'s upon me. I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi. Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings. Who sold everything on a quest for God\'s Divine. Slept in caves to get a clear mind. Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise. I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds. Been in the mouth of many leopards. Felt the death kiss of Satan\'s mistress. Walk through vacant districts. before religions I studied pagan scriptures. True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions. Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted. Candles lit, gamble with a bitch. Who made me love her when I touch her, soft paws hide claws. Bees with sweet honey in they mouth. Have bitter stingers at they tail. Embracing her was like embracing the third rail. '

And as I passed the chronic,. But all the homies hit liqs and rob and steal. And keep fat pockets. But neglected minds be gettin\' left behind. The word "peace" is just an expression. Used to say bye when it\'s time to jet. And them red black and green medallions. Was all just part of the trend, I guess. Hardly ever them around brothers\' necks no more.

So good, man I feel like I could be the 8th wonder of the world. And the 9th is on the track bitch. On track 'til I go hoarse. Hear my voice, and they pray that they never hear the chorus. Seen blood, sweat and tears like a locker room. We grind so when we shop out we cop out, like precincts. We ain't on the court but everything is getting boxed out. Got it on lock, you just locked out. Skinny jeans, but a nigga still hood. I bet they thought they'd never see a Big gone good. Saw Puff, I was finna' speak. Nigga turn around and he recognise me. And it's time to make a real nigga separation. I used to be the most humble until. I figured out that it don't matter for real. Now I'm arrogant. My power awesome like Austin Powers with his mojo. Start beef bigger then your spouse. Should be harder to find. Than diggin' in your couch, looking for your car keys. Give it back with a sensitive mouth and some hard knees. caked up.

S"That damier bag I bought her. Caught the attention of those niggas on it. That cell phone that I bought is probably filled with some other niggas numbers. So it leaves me to wonder, why do I still promise to love her. Cut me off every time I'm talkin'. Which means she ain't never hear nothing. I say stay, she wanna leave. She get her point across so I gotta let her be. I'ma let her be by herself in peace. But five years from now I bet she see. When the club gets played. The things you crave are no longer escapes. And no longing for dates. You want a husband, but no one has a cape. Now you wonder and wait, and I ain't tryin' to hear what you want me to say. It feels good to be over you, babe. So play this shit while you contemplate, contemplate, contemplate. Play this shit while you contemplate. Play this shit while you contemplate. [Hook: Rihanna]. Who am I living for, is this my limit. Can I endure some more. Chances are giving, questions existing. Who am I living for,. is this my limit. Can I endure some more. Chances are giving. Questions existing. [Verse 2]. Them people, they talkin'; them lights, they on me. This life I chose, but I ain't know, til I found it. To be honest, I'm modest; one hater for every nigga on it. One day everybody is applaudin' the next day you is everybody target. Why bother, why talk to em, where God at, I need to call Him. My knees on the ground, dear Father: don't let me break, please make me stronger. How much longer, will it linger. Well my heart is giving, will they believe it. When my song is over will they need me. Watch how quickly they find a new leader. Questioning the whole meaning. In the Viper Room, just me and River Phoenix. With Courtney Love in Lake Washington. With a note there and I'm thinking of reading. This ain't hard, Chris Benoit. Heath Ledger said the nights gon' be dark. Feel the size of a Phyllis Hyman note. Apollo Theater I just might not go. Franky Lymon, the lime light gets old. Cold so in a while I'm schizo. I can't cope, I can't think; I can't breathe, this ain't me. This ain't easy, I'm thinking; am I doing this for them or me. I can't think, am I doing this for them or me. "

Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty. She said, "Let\'s hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck". I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this\'ll do. I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too.". She said she understood then everything was kosher. I gave her a Lil\' Will CD, and a fuckin poster. It\'s like that now.

But you can not call it that cause it was slummer. Well it was more like spend the night. Three in the morning yawnin dancin under street lights. We chillin like a villain and a nigga feelin right. In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite. All of the bullshit we on our back starin at the stars above. (aww man) Talkin bout what we gonna be when we grow up. I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive" (hmm). It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes. I coulda died, time went on, I got grown. Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home. To find lil Sasha was gone. Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treatin her wrong. I kept on singin my song and hopin at a show. That I would one day see her standin in the front row. But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school. With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper. Herrrrrre we go.... [Verse Three: Slick Rick]. Throwing things, yelling in a mad high pitch. Here we go again with this psychopath bitch. The neighbors will hear you, you misfit. Can\'t disagree with the bitch without this shit. The price we pay to fuck women. The most pretty bitch got the psycho shit within them. Stuck up, as soon as I pop up. But see me with the next she wanna tear the fucking club up. Learned more and more, they\'re just shit to dump sperm in. And you know, probably get cussed if I backslap Miss. While she busy trying to justify who cheated first. I oughta cut her off, let another sooth me. But I don\'t know, ordinary bitch don\'t move me. I mean, I tried to fall in love with a bittie.

And I just give them D, give them D like they is out the league. Hasheem Thabeet and various other peoples. The pressures of greatness always comes with critiquing. Newest of sneakers, you consuming the bleachers. Blewin' some reefer in my zone like a 2-3 defense. Double-M G up, we up, y'all just relax. See uh, all my females show bust, Curtis Enis. Nittany Lion,. my Penn State it, niggas recite it. I'm Michael Jordan major, you niggas Harold Miner. Pussy be all on me, we too young for romancin'. My niggas never block, I think I'm Barry Sanders.

With this recording I'm as sick as Jordan before Game 6. Jazz talkin, I bet I pick and roll with your bitch. You got some paper for me? Hit me on the Hornacek. Walter Payton Mercedez, sweetness in every ride. Hold on my pupils slowing,. I don't got no lazy eye. Kicking flows,. pockets about as thick as strippers on poles. Zone blocking with these bitches, I'm just picking a hole. Pardon that jargon but since I'm balling they getting salty. They all catching feelings, I should Biletnikoff 'em. Them niggas talking, they like man he official. Man, you Olowokandi I'm just being Pacific. I'm just bein' prolific, right now don't need no Mrs. I got a rack of Trojans, no ring, my Lane Kiffin. I'm tryin' pimp em I'm trying to be that cool. All them bitches Converse with me off that React Juice. Now Jordan III my shoe, Double M G my crew. When you do it big as Manute you make it seem minute. Ricky Moore Flightposite, Mike Bibby blue Foams. Interscope feeling like Charlotte when they traded Kobe you know?. But I let it go,. Rozay finna re-up. He got himself a Kobe and they stuck with Vlade Divac. And we no la de de da. I don't care for any people. Shallow bitches go Hail Mary when I throw that D-Route.

Wintertime bubble goose, goose, clouds of smoke. Whip smelling like fish from 125th. Throwin' ketchup on my fries. baseball spliffs. Back seat with my leg all stiff. tartar sauce on my S Dot kicks. Rocks is lit while I'm poppin' the clips. I'm ready for war, got to call the Cuban guys. Got the Montana booth in front of the store. Made my usual gun check, safety off. Frank. The moment is here, take your fuckin' hood off and tell the driver to stay put. Fuck them niggas on the block they shook, most of them won't look. They frontin', they no crooks they fuck up they own juks. Look out for Jackson 5-0 cause they on foot. Straight ahead is the doorway, see that lady with the shopping cart. She keep a shottie cocked in the hallway. Damn she look pretty old Ghost. She work for Kevin, she 'bout seventy seven. She paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses' wedding. Flew to Venezuela quickly when the big fed stepped in. 3 o'clock, watch the kids. third floor, last door. You look paranoid that's why I can't juks with you. Why? Why you behind me leery?. Shakey Dog stutterin', when you got the bigger cooker on you. You is a crazy motherfucker. small Hoodie dude. Hilarious move, you on some Curly, Moe, Larry shit. Straight parry shit, Krispy Kreme, cocaine, dead bodies, jail time you goin' carry it. Matter of fact, all the cash, I'm a carry it. Stash it in jelly and break it down at the Marriott. This is the spot, yo son your burner cocked?. These fuckin' maricons on the couch watchin' Sanford and Son. Passin' they rum, fried plantains and rice. Big round onions on a T-bone steak, my stomach growling. Yo I want some. Hold on, somebody's comin', get behind me, knock at the door. Act like you stickin' me up, put the joint to my face. Push me in quickly when the bitch open up. Remember you don't know me, blast him if he reach for his gun. Yo who goes there? Tony, Tony one second homie. No matter rain, sleet or snow you know you supposed to phone me. Off came the latch, Frank pushed me into the door. The door flew open, dude had his mouth open. heat bulgin'. Told him Freeze! lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment. Frank snatched his gat, slapped him, asked him. Where's the cash, coke and the crack? Get to smokin' you fast. His wife stood up speakin' in Spanish. Big tittie bitch holdin' the cannon. Ran in the kitchen, threw a shot, the kick in the four fifth. Broke a bone in her wrist and she dropped the heat. Give up the coke! But the bitch wouldn't listen. I'm on the floor like holy shit! Watchin my man Frank get busy. He zoned out, finished off my man's wiz. He let the pitbull out, big head Bruno with the little shark's teeth chargin'. Foamin' out the mouth, I'm scared. Frank screamin', blowin' shots in the air. Missin' his target, off the Frigidare, it grazed my ear. Killed that bullshit pit, ran to the bathroom butt first. Frank put two holes in the doorman's Sassoon. The big one had the centipede stab wound. Frank shot the skinny dude, laid him out. The bigger dude popped Frankie boy, played him out. To be continued. "

The whole hood ran up on me, I was like "Damn!". So I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently. Arguments, face up in the air like you hatin me. Ask you one question,. was it good?. He have you on the wall like me, was it. Hood?. You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top. Grabbin the. Sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot. I came home on Friday, Saturday I found out. That night I cried with the kids. And my man, I\'mma do him in. And the Lord knows best what I\'mma do to him. And you can keep the crib - all I\'m sayin is. Let me find out you got men around my kids. It was the beauty that caught me and held my soul hostage. \'Member those days had you smellin my boxes. We could push through the grimiest streets, then throw it up. Like "That\'s my nigga!". To find out that bird nigga tappin my shit. It\'s alright \'do, maybe he came up with the right dough. [Carl Thomas] 2x. It was like ecstasy girl. Found out it was dizzin ya world. Had us livin in a fantasy world. I wish we never broke up girl. "Who bought this?" I bought that. Knowin damn well in reality you bought jack. You ain\'t lift one finger, but you claimin what\'s yours. We used to dress like twins - sweats, baby blue Timbs. You even scratched my Benz, let the pigs in. '

S'Start to scream out loud, "Wu-Tang\'s back for more". and plus the cold war. This rhyme you digest through the RZA console. X Y  slam Nine Diagram pole. Raekwon dropped the bomb,. Hunchback Notre Dame. Golden Arms. is bronze Buddha palm. hit Qu\'ran. It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme. supreme team. America\'s Cream Team, redeemed. Vidal Sassoon. chrome tones. hear the moans of Al Capone. Gun POW to the dome. and split the bone. Wig blown off the ledge. by the alledged. Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge. One dose of my feroc\' handheld trigger cuts. Acapella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched. And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical. Cords. dope swords, five star general. Raw be the quote rap style sore throat. Through the fully operational, handheld totem. A hundred thousand times one. snatch up my styles get done. I hold a title, and here\'s how my belt was won, check it. Slick majestic. broke mics are left infected. Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort. You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes. My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges. Masked Avenger. I appear to blow your ear like wind. With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear. So sit back and let the king explore. Describe me, the kid\'s nice and he holds swords. attack\'s the nerve like migraines. With more gains than beggars on trains. Poisonous Rebel like Deck. you can\'t destroy this. You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this. A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black. My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture. Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster. Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect. That fills more body bags than apartments in projects. And as far as the coroners know. The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow. Put on by my family brought to the academy. Of the Wu and learnt how to. Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly. Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit. MCs submit to the will as I kill your. Juvenile freestyle,. civilize the mental. Devils worship this like an icon. Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python. [Verse 4: Cappadonna]. You heard other raps before but kept waiting. For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong. Beats never worthy of my cause. , I prolong. Extravaganza, time sits still. No propaganda, be wary of the skill. As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum. Lebanon Don. Malcolm X beat threat. CD massacre, murder to cassette. I blow the shop up, you ain\'t seen nothing yet. Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh. Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream. Discombumberate your technique and your scheme. Four course applause. like a black jack to dat. You\'re stuck on stupid like I\'m stuck on the map. Nowhere to go except next show bro. Entertaining motherfuckers can\'t stop O. In battling,. you don\'t want me to start tattling. All up on the stage cause y\'all snakes keep rattling. Bitch, you ain\'t got nothing on the rich. Every other day my whole dress code switch. clock me like Sherry. All y\'all crab bitches ain\'t got to worry. Can\'t get a nigga like Don dime a dozen. Even if I\'m smoked out I can\'t be scoped out. I\'m too ill,. Park Hill. See my face on the twenty dollar bill. Cash it in, and get ten dollars back. The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax. Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve. Put all the other LPs back on the shelf. And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7. 1-6-0-4-9-3-11. And you could get long dick hip-hop affection. I damage any MC who step in my direction. I\'m Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard. Niggas still talking that shit is absurd. My repertoire, is U.S.S.R. P.L.O. style got thrown out the car. And ran over by the Method Man Jeep. Divine can\'t define my style is so deep. Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy. Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine. Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design. I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind. Cause you weak in the knees like SWV. Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee. Kid change your habit. you know I\'m friends with the Abbott. Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet. Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years. Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears. In Born Power, born physically, power speaking. The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching. '

S"We them cats talking noise behind that New York trash heap. Where the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep. And it's, worker zig-zagers versus piggy badge flashers. Training Generation Fallout. Waterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out. There's smoke in my iris. But I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids. So I'm ready now (What you ready for?). I'm ready for life in this city. And my wings have grown almost enough to lift me. I'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass. Don't tell me you ain't the droid that held the match to the charcoals. Don't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool. I'm not trying to graduate to life at the personalized barstool. Head in a jar on the desk, feet dangling in a shark pool. My name stands for my being. And my being stands for the woman who stood. And braved the storm to raise the seedling. (Brother, sun, sister, moon, mother beautiful). Yeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence. Back in a long time ago, I was to way the wishes wish. But missers miss, I slept through my appointment. Saw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify. And picked the rose that wilted. The second I introduced myself as Nervous. Well it appears the scars of learning have spoken. Some are burning, some have frozen. Some deserve tall tales, some wrote them. Some are just a brutal repercussion of devotion. Mine are all of the above cuz everything leads to erosion. Now where I live there's a homeless man, he sits upon a crate. He makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make. Now if you ever come and visit me, I suggest you watch the show. Tell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this. And I ain't getting any younger. My knuckles wear their bruises well. I've yet to lose that hunger. But only time can tell. Prodigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch. And crucify bigot voodoo doll on two popsicle sticks. See your name is Ambiguity. My name is something hands can't hold. But hearts part ocean scapes. just to watch the starlet unfold. It's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick. Knowing the wind'll kill it some day, still it calls my burning wits for now. And if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest. But starving artists die, I set my alarm for five o'clock. Idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing. The Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds. To the opening, scarlet carpets. Leading the stubborn mule to cruel rugburn. But y'all numb from gut fuel. I administer eclipse, there ain't no motor like a martyr-made motor. Cuz a martyr-made motor don't quit. I am webbed foot mammal. Channel surfing my way to the top. Tugboat in a bottle. With no holes poked in the nozzle. I fed em bedlam diluted in limelight. Till that rookie boogie graduated hostile. And the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the median. The second my halo ran outta helium. Demoted to thorn crown, damn talk about numbskull. I was born bound to a stencil called symmetry. But my energy's a rental. So I take this now to say. Thank you senorita for holding a flame to a lost wick. Thank you James Anthony for the band-aids on my ego. Y'all are family for life. I'll take that bullet to preserve you. I wanna be something spectacular. On the day the sun runs outta batteries. Attach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy. Save my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn. Then sit up on his crate as I witness the beauty born like this. (I ain't gettin' any younger). *Horn samples to end*. "

Layin' on my back in the sun dried mud. There's no point in even trying to get up. I got my eyes glued to the blue sky above. And it's been a beautiful summer. It reminds me of when I was younger. Used to count down to the sound of thunder. I smell fresh cut grass mixed with the burnt rubber. And I don't need to take a glance to know. Cause' I can hear the traffic as it passes slow. They' on the other side of the window. Checkin' out the damage, lookin' at the show. I can hear the sirens get near. Mama used to tell us to plug our ears. It get's so loud and clear. Until every other noise disappears.... And right now I'm tryin' to block it out. By imagining the sounds that come out your mouth. I saw two birds fly south. And I thought about the day we bought that house. You played your cards, had to stand strong. But it ain't that hard to sing a sad song. We all got scars and broken parts. But most of the marks stay close to my heart. The rain clouds over my head got dark. And then I saw my angel cut through the storm. She was in a firefighter uniform. I close my eyes so I can see some more. And for the first ever I remember bein' born. "

I hang around outside of they buildin\' amongst the vagrants. Dangerous, loaded stainless, maturity plus minority. Cool as cues, but cocked back is the priority. One in the flesh, lights, cops just stop where they stand. As I proceed to beat the publishing up outta this man. Tellin\' him "Get the fuck up!" They yellin "How could he stand?". I don\'t expect him to, bitch,. I counted close to the land. The reverend might win a visit, that is if his spirit is near it. But if you yield towards hell you\'d hear it more vivid. But I\'m under slumber, ya get it?. To see it I\'d have to let you all.... Yeah, once upon a time I seen it clearer than the bluest day. Got off in some crime seen that line turn blueish-grey. Humorin\' themselves about murder, pussy and politics. Word around the world is money and I want all of it. World crooked like St. Ide\'s eyes acknowledge this. Just ask them Virginia Tech college kids. While you wait for apologies, I\'m low like a fox. Get between me and your rocks, I\'ll put your ass in the box. I feel the odds favor robbin\' a world without God. Money\'s the language, in humanity you need Visa cards. I need your cash and your car before I smash your facade. Or watch this classic toy make you collapse to the side, under the yard boy. Since a child these thoughts lurkin\' in my shadows. Heard \'em placin\' wages on how will I face my battles. Accelerate to add dope feel but never faulted. I\'m standin\' upon rock that\'ll make powder out Gibraltar. Fumblin\' with sweat on my fingers, somethin\' impetuous lingers. Become infected with feelings so I\'m electing this evil. To end my life without reason cause I\'m indicted for treason. Closin\' my eyes and I\'m leakin\',. draggin\' the knife till I\'m bleedin\'. Cause it\'s the life that I\'m seekin\',. feels only right that I\'m meetin\'. With Jesus seeking redemption but he don\'t want my repentance. For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression. Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence. The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin\' my blessings. Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen. Parents repeatedly sentenced, heroin needles on dressers. They use to feed their infection, I can\'t repeat indescretions. So I pause for reflection, long for honest affection. And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches. If you knew where my head is when I\'m doing these records. You\'d never listen to my music again, I can\'t let you...... "I want to live a real life..... I don\'t want to dream any longer". '

That\'s the day I was gonna cut ya throat. Ever since the accident I\'ve been dying to speak to you. Things are a lot better, I promise I won\'t harass you with any letters. Saying shit like "We should be together". I got a new attitude, really, I ain\'t mad at you. I just wanted you to recognize I got talent too. They did some tests on me at NIH in Maryland. They showed me techniques to help me deal with pressure. Whenever I remember that crazy night when I was being reckless. Driving with a deathwish, on the bridge and I crashed into a Lexus. Right before I finished that last sentence. I was listenin to Xzibit\'s album "Restless". The next thing I knew I was under water and breathless. I was unconscious for a second, literally dying to go to heaven. Till some fellas came and pulled me from the wreckage. They started CPR, then they called the paramedics. In retrospect I probably shoulda used a gun to end it. By the time the car sunk. My pregnant girlfriend was still in the trunk. He hopped in the back of the ambulance and rolled up some weed. I just remember his voice talking to me. I wanted to be an emcee. Matta fact, I think he met you. It was the day you came to his video shoot with DJ, Jimmy\'s nephew. \'Clef stepped to him and told him he should step to you. That you was ghost writing for L, but that wasn\'t true. You was looking at him the same way I\'m looking at you. Why can\'t we be friends Em\', I don\'t want nothingfrom you. there\'s a little bit of Stan in all of us.

Niggas hustle and shoot. In the Garden State, it grows stink weeds and criminals. Government funds are minimal. Oppression\'s subliminal. These days its hard for we to find peace of mind. Between insanity and sanity there lies a thin line. Some dwell in hotels with Jezebels. A stone age and fall a victim to the Plague. Unclean bad dreams of Wyclef being a fiend. sweet serpentine. Now who would think that your best friend. Would be your worst enemy and your enemy your best friend. Like Alex Haley, take notes on this biography. My family tree consists of street refugees. A ghetto land where we talk slang. Stolen cars bang like my chitty bang-bang sh-bang. Just walkin\' the streets death can take you away. It\'s never guaranteed that you\'ll see the next day. Shaton. But if I fall asleep and death takes me away. Don\'t be surprised, son, I wasn\'t put here to stay. At night the evil armies of Shaton don\'t play. Fifty-two pick up. Fifty-two thousand in cash, I don\'t want no savings bonds. Have the money ready, I smell something fishy. Your wife\'s in my custody, one false move and you\'ll find her body in the sea. That\'s the voice of the kid, that\'s the kidnapper. I do my work and then I catch my ticket to Jamaica. Meet me in the alley, make sure you bring the money. This ain\'t the seventies, I\'m far from a jive turkey. My circle it can\'t be broken open, cut-throatin\', provokin\'. Record promotin. tokin\', chokin\' on they words like smoke. Cause we soft spoken, doesn\'t mean that we\'ve forgotten. Your booty smells rotten and one day you will be gotten. See, jokers is scatter-brained, their focus is unrestrained. My army is trained. you never find us beefin\' in vain. Cause I\'ve seen fire and I\'ve seen rain. I can judge a character like Ito judge a verdict. And if you bringin\' threats I give you sex if I ain\'t heard it. Or so the beast said when they served it. that shit is nervous. So what\'s my purpose? Family, we must preserve it. Your number\'s retired, I hope you like the hell fires. You\'ll be screamin\' "Murder She Wrote" like Chaka Demus and Pliers. Just walkin\' the streets death can take you away. It\'s never guaranteed that you\'ll see the next day. Shaton. But if I fall should asleep and death takes me away. Don\'t be surprised, son, I wasn\'t put here to stay. At night the evil armies of Shaton don\'t play. We used to jump rope, but now we gun hope. Bustin\' shots off of project roof tops. Sending signals with the blunt smoke. If you think lips sink ships. imagine full Glock clips. I hold a glass of Remy Martin. Extortin\' the lightweights for thinkin\' they important. You see I stay on top of shit like a fly. My niggas reach when they got beef, then jet down to South Beach. Just walkin\' the streets death can take you away. It\'s never guaranteed that you\'ll see the next day. Shaton. But if I should fall asleep and death takes me away. Don\'t be surprised, son, I wasn\'t put here to stay. At night the evil armies of Shaton don\'t play. '

I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow. I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back. My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack. Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler. I got money - I got juice. I got to the party and I got loose. I got funky. I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey. Because I'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell. I got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell. Sittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube. Eating Colonel's chicken. drinkin' Heineken brew.

S'What are we to Heart Huckabee, . art fuckery suddenly. Not enough young in his lung for the water wings. Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch. Like, "I\'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt.". Fine, sign of the time we elapse. When a primate climb up a spine and attach. Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines. They get a rise out of frogs and flies. So when a dogfight\'s hog-tied prize sort of costs a life. The mouths water on a fork and knife. And the allure isn\'t right. No score on a war-torn beach. Where the cash cow\'s actually beef. Blood turns wine when it leak for police. Like, "That\'s not a riot; it\'s a feast, let\'s eat!". And I will remember your name and face. On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast. And I will rejoice in your fall from grace. With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass.". None shall pass, none shall pass. Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn\'t fix. You wouldn\'t relate to the rogue vocoder blitz. How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz. ?Cause he wouldn\'t play rollover fetch like a bitch. And express no regrets. Though he isn\'t worth a homeowner\'s piss. To the jokers who pose by the glitz. Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm. When a king is a whore who comply and conform. Miles outside of the eye of the storm. With a siphon to lure out a prize and award. While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war. True blue triumph is more. Like, "Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold. Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go.". Sat where the old, cardboard city folk. Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw. On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast. And I will rejoice in your fall from grace. With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass.". None shall pass, none shall pass. You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me. You\'ve got a, you\'ve, you\'ve got a, a lot of nerve. I\'m, I\'m not, I\'m not, trying to trick you. I\'m try, I\'m try, I\'m trying to help. Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this. Duty and death; anyone object, come stand in the way. You could be my little Snake River Canyon today. And I ran with a chain of commands. And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can. Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd. When I cut a belly open to find what climb out. That\'s quite a bit of gusto he muster up. To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough\'s enough!". It must\'ve struck a nerve so they huff and puff. \'Til all the king\'s men fluster and clusterfuck. And it\'s a beautiful thing, to my people who keep an impressive wingspan even when the cubicle shrink. You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed. And march him through the machine. On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast. And I will rejoice in your fall from grace. With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass.". None shall pass, none shall pass. '

God shit the planet screaming "What on Earth is that?". I sit back five dimensions. Only to mostly over cook the specimen. Vending tragic fatality successful dodging volleys. All Hail Marys and Hello Dollies!. I flow ridiculous, indigenous to now. Who holds the fifth golden ticket?. Saw the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets. The house next door to when the stickball clears the fence. Y\'all hesitate to fetch it!. I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape. Pterodactyl circling turtle. I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow. Suck and rust the oxygen in gulps. And spit the metal directly back up the barrel. We icegrill the silhouettes (right). The common decency factors a lowball estimate of zero. My testament is striking b-boy stances. Dancing past the foggy mirror. the billy goat beard camouflage the spirit. I\'m at six degrees of sexy sarcasm. Yeah never swam up inside summerjam classic. Another bent backwards bastard. Scouring the carnival grounds for an outlet. WHO THE FUCK IS AES ROCK?. I\'m not a name to keep at arms length. Adjacent to little. Linus. quilt makeshift. Sick security mechanism, check your mission. I am not a vision, check your mission. Just a simple sourpatch delinquent. No it will not help you shove your Lincoln. I alone settle. I alone peddle in the mud. I alone, I condone rebel zone planting. I alone stand in a social coma. All up to your dome, follow I alone. [Sample: Method Man]. Well he was maverick enough but still scraped up. Taki 183 innovation for the kids. Brick foot ironlung honor. Escape through the night like a disgruntled teen Krylon bomber. Without a care, aside from posting the roster. Mal-adjusted blank faced civilian dispersed feelings. Reeling in several separate defunct fame-booster modules. This nervous twitch mark the most delectable ingredient. See Aesop starving troopers in cell blocks with strap-on feeding bins. (More like) Like I\'d auction off a fuck for that blind cause you ride in. I\'d rather find the flaws and watch you hide \'em. Feel the haggard look penetrate brain castle. Blasting clear out the back of this batches sour wind collection. (FLASH FLOODER!). You\'re a fuckin wind-up toy. A goddamn four string criminal trading card. The reason they decorate the fonts of closing credits. To boost on-looker amusement after fading hard. Catch more Z\'s than Rip Van Winkle\'s 12 Step Narcolepsy Seminar. Action! we all compete the masked illusion. The commonfolk, I provoke em all. Challenge dirty balance. I elope with talent while they fidget. If the revolution ain\'t gon\' be televised.

S'I\'m telling you, put your money on me then triple your bet. ?Cause I won\'t be satisfied till I\'m set. Till I got a triplex out in Tribeca with the skyline effect. Rhyming is the nine-to-five that I manipulate best. How to tongue twist, how to enunciate certain shit. How to control your breath, how to make your syllables spit. You niggas ain\'t listen to Bis, I kill ?em with shit. I\'m wicked with this, I should be selling tickets to this. Paparazzi should probably be taking pictures of this. My fans in the street with signs tryna picket for this. Saying, "We want ?Bis! We want ?Bis!. We want the rapper with the illest lyrics!. My dedication and my commitment\'s beginning-less. I can go four quarters or nine innings for this. Go twelve rounds, play two days of cricket for this. Lead crusades across Europe like the Christians for this. The notion I\'m dedicated is an understatement. My rhymes are out of this world like the Russian space-station. Sneak-attack rappers, grab them and slash them. Chop their heads off with claws sharper than velociraptors. Action packed like Shaft, the black assassin. Blasting the .753 backwards Magnum. the road to Damascus. I and I come fe manifest the most high. Drink a gallon of cyanide and still can not die. Beat your ass like Lennox Lewis did to David Tua. Your face will be swollen like the Benihana Buddha. Beyond the length of this rhyme you have no future. Put your mic down and step away from it. Shut your motherfucking mouth and don\'t say nothing. You have the right to remain silent. Sentenced to life on Rikers Island for terrible freestyling. I heard a rumour English women make love the best. Is that true?. Till they get karate kicked in the mouth and their teeth get ejected. Told you to watch who you beef with on the last record. Platinum teeth? I sell them for a thousand pounds a piece. You buy one back and you get one free. Put it down in the east, put it down in the west. Put it down on paper, put the paper down on the desk. In the studio is where I put it down to the test. It\'s nothing but skull-crushing pressure down at them depths. Throw a rough mix down, download it to disk. Give a copy to everybody that\'s down with Bis. Since \'96, the Dogg Pound Remix. Pakman. Till I hear my voice banging up and down the block in a Magnavox. With a hundred watts. creating ripples in the water like aquanauts. Breathing through their oxygen-box. I belong on top of the pops not on the bottom with rocks. I mean, honest to God, I\'m shocked, I thought the album was hot. I guess you can\'t write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind. That\'s why rhymes like mine mystify mankind. But when it comes to rhymes like mine the word ?time\' doesn\'t apply. You see, rhyming is the art. The microphone is the paintbrush responsible for getting the point across. The canvas is the street. Where the Master of the Ceremony paints the picture for everybody to see. I\'m as graceful as the left hand of Rembrandt. Put some instrumentals on and ask my pen to dance. I\'m such a gentleman,. '

You tried to diss but can't even spit, you just stand there and wish. Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king. You see, that's my problem, I spit a thousand bars y'all was silent. I had to give you three years to recognize. My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats. The blogosphere is where you vent frustration and discontent. But children don't understand the concept of consequence. But no I will not accept what the media says. There are forces above them that feed off our stress, suffering and debt. I am Dead by Design, cause nobody tells me what to rhyme. I make up my own fucking mind. There are more of us than them. But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men. Thirteen levels above 33, let me say it again. They are gods and we are just mortal men. I cannot imagine their power. They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours. You tryna to plan a great escape? You're a coward. They gon' make us march into a gas chamber make us think we're taking a shower. The children of Zion belong to Skynet, nobody knows who's behind it. So if you don't care, fine then, I don't care either. But I ain't spineless like you, I'm a true believer. In the metaphysical aether, you listening to the lyrical reaper. After this album they gon' call me a leader. But I'm not, Killuminati just gon' murder me like Pac. Blood sacrifice or not, I don't even wanna be alive. If it's like that, then fuck Tiamaat. Well fuck you for standing there staring, fuck everything on this planet. Including the evil spirits, notwithstanding the aliens. Acting like they don't hear us, there's no need to fear us. Just come done and help us, I love James Brown. more than I love Elvis. But that don't mean I'm selfish. Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish. You scream for hardcore, I felt it. But what you gon' do when they kill me on some Eminem and L shit?. Cause let me tell you why, you a coward and you don't know shit. Cause if my Brothers stand next to me, the energy expands collectively. The world was never ready for me. And they ain't ready for their own freedom neither, they perish from the heater. The fire breathers crawl out of their cage to eat 'em. Like thin crust pizza, Cthulhu creatures with rough features. Jeepers creepers, good luck with Jesus. I run up in the Vatican with demons, just to get even. That's where the biggest demon is. It's no secret, but nobody else sees it, so they won't believe it. But that's when I calm back down, the key word is back down. I got possessed by my own raps, wow. Knock knock, who's home? The black Dan Brown. My ghostwriter's not around, plus it was just a freestyle. But at least I got better beats now. Meanwhile, motherfuckers still mad, I feel bad. I'd apologize but you acting like a real fag. What the fuck I'm supposed to feel like?. But I don't want to talk to you now. It'd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around. They still ask me about 'Second Round' even now. Can't get over it, they ask me a loaded question. And act like I was the one promoting it, hang up on 'em. You a cyborg unit with no soul to it. And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships. "

S'Her name was Kim, this light skinned girl from. Shaolin. Stood by my side when my world was caved in. Every time she told me she loved me, I said, "no backsies". No honey in pockets, all I had was the change. .45 stainless, it got so deep I threw the heat to my dome. She said "If you shoot, you ain\'t the real Pretty Tone". Baby, come home, you not alone, be strong whether right or wrong. Our bond is even more stronger when the light is gone. Say, "Yo, Starks relax, you know I got the hot water runnin. Baby, oil you down, pots in the oven". Long talks at night, arguments and still try\'nna solve. Whether who is right, we mad tight. My favorite sweetheart, cum, but don\'t ever stop. Your love, give me every drop, you kiss get\'s me very hot. Never felt feelings before, and felt so sure. Every time you put it on me, I feen for more. Word to fuck up, like Ralph, baby, your the greatest. I\'mma sell my guns, and with the cash I\'mma bring you to Vegas. To all the ladies who love they man. Though they fuck up, and you still let them back in. Make some noise if you cook and you clean for \'em. Out of love, doing juks for them. Kiss \'em in the morning, hold \'em,. '

And I\'m just trying to drive it once again. Baby, you got a body like a Benz. And I\'m just trying to drive it once again. A good woman is scarce to us. And I wasn\'t prepared to love.

In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I\'m like. "Tight, let\'s keep it AMG". Top down, let me kiss your physique. I\'m digging your fleek. I\'m checkin\' your gear. Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet. She like when I drive it, I like it in park. Pull that thing over you likely to sore. I got her floating like riding on stars. So I keep it GPS, see where this going. Nothing will stop it, I slide in no prob. Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts. Sex is her weapon, my snake in her garden.

Put your hands up for PHERE or fear itself. Or write it off as balances and cheques. Or take the sign out the window and change it to say you want to help. And maybe we can talk him into walking up these steps. Keep looking up. Try to count them. How many left. Look em up. One at a time, until your out of breath. One foot infront of the other. Right, left. And spend your whole life climbing these steps. (Brother). For every boy that she allows to step on her heart. She comes one step closer to findin what she needs. The sad part is shes still stuck somewhere behind the start. Still doesnt know what it takes to make it leave. That tattoo bleeds upon the paid dues. Break the rules, to balance the odds, challenge her God. The untrained eye thinks shes got it all together. But the first time I seen her smile I knew better. Write down the letters, piece them in order. Make sense out of a sentence, give the picture a border. Got to sort through the images that clutter the soul. But the photo got fried cause the shutter didn't close. Over exposed, too many steps, too soon. Killed the pain with a. Jameson. Blue Moon. She climbs, she cries, she waits. How many more can she take before her legs break. So if you're doing bad I'mma sing about you. And if you're doing good I'mma sing about you. Whether or not you knew I've been singin about you. It's all I know, I don't know what else to do. When you take a step I take a step. Or maybe it's the other way around I'm not too sure. Right and wrong got together, the vision was blurred. The path was crooked but the intentions were pure. And I count these steps getting closer to home. And I love each step like it was my own. And when I reach the top of the goal or whatever. Maybe finally they'll let me forget her. [Hook] {2X}. (Don't stop looking up). "

From the seeds you planted gently. Thanks for being there for me. And all the time you spent with me. Love sent for me(?), if I could only have that day back. To sit down and rap, shoot the breeze and have a chat. But the fact still remains, still later, on the day I have to meet our maker. I write my feelings on the paper, for now. Along the golf course where you once played. I see you as I drive by, I feel you like your presence is there. I stop and I stare, I see the pictures of days we shared. Well aware that you cared, makin' sure I was prepared for life. The hardships, the struggles, the garbage, and the troubles. That come with it, always kept my head lifted.

Habitual living, daily schedule consisted of:. Work, television, and sexual moments. But sometimes it gets so hopeless. When nonsense raises an octave, thoughts blocks all sensual focus. With a firm grasp on the grudge they both clutch in the name of love. Fear of the results had push ever came to shove. Seduced for fun, produce a lot of fight. Two youths on the run, learning some truth about life. The time, the talks they share walking around Calhoun. And when she watches the look on his face as he sleeps. She recalls every inch as to how it got this deep. Now how am I to know you like the way I laugh?. I can't read the map, no one's ever seen the path. Oh you going out? what time you gon' be back?. Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world. Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl. Let's all take seats, please quiet during the performance. Trying to read the script, keep getting trapped in the margins. That the people that surrounded her seemed to expect the world. He doesn't know the difference between come and go. She dyed her hair black, maybe now she can relax. Maybe now the regulars will stare half as hard. Existence validation printed on the monthly statements. That come from MasterCard. He thinks she sleeps too much. She thinks he spends too much. He thinks her friends are jokes. She thinks he's out of touch. He thinks she drinks too much. She thinks he thinks too much. It's all another phase turning the page in the book of growing up. She has seen a lot of sex. He tried to hide his resentment, but there wasn't nothing thing left for them to label new. Together they shared the sacred practices of breathing. The weather was fair, however the hovering clouds weren't leaving. They had old lovers on the side, old flames. That somehow managed to spark regardless of the pouring rains. And each time they mix up the ingredients. They recheck the recipe to see maybe they're reading it incorrectly. Collect me, consume me, release me, snuggle. Two geniuses putting together the pieces to a blank puzzle. Every time I chase a squirrel it rips apart my world.

But see life moves on and broke niggas can\'t change it. Age ten, new step family arrangement. At thirteen, started gettin\' hair on my dick. And noticed me and my sister were gettin\' treated like shit. Physical contact was in form of a slap. At the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back. Courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap. Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black. Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate. Into juvenile detention where I built up hate. I don\'t remember the date of the judicial debate. But legally I was now in custody of the state. And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink. Say what\'s up to Xzibit and I still don\'t speak. I\'m trying to contemplate the next move to make. I gotta find some way, Xzibit carry the weight. Verse Two:. And that was worse than the treatment I was gettin\' at home. Only now I was fucked up plus all alone. My father talkin\' all crazy to me over the phone. Turned age sixteen now on my own. Started running with cats who carried gats cause they had too. With no hesitation lock load then blast you. Without a hassle, we in a town of hicks. Fuckin\' all these chicks. So we feelin\' like we mothafuckin\' Nino Brown. At the house when the mothafuckin\' man touched down. Screamin\' demands "Let me see your goddamn hands (now)". A.T.F. cause of handguns and contraband. Never kept it in the house. So of course we clowned. Only found one pistol took us all down town. We be out by the end of the afternoon. Gettin\' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM!. Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife. Ty and Matt caught bodies. Now they spend there life behind bars. Catchin\' scars that will not heal. Niggas don\'t know the half about keepin\' it real. '

What you see was predicted before. We were already warned of this bloody drug war. Wherever you sell it wherever you go. Ya still being clocked by the cops, ya know.

Skip to ya loo with your High Pro Glow. Ya not stim off life, ya stimulated off blow. Or the new improved, ask beaming Jack. Criza, criza, crack. My people you were forced then brought. Stripped from your jewels brainwashed and then taught. To hate, deceive and dislike each other. Separating themselves, you're not my brother. Sit up at home for a mystery. Face-valuing things that you can't see. Can't taste can't smell, hear or feel. But senses prove everything is real. I'm here to present a positive way. If strong you'll accord if weak you'll stray. Drug users are stuck in the mud. Another 20th century modern day chud. These cannibal humanoid undernourished dwellers. Just took your check to the heroin cellar. Dope addicts, that walk and roam. Might have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS, doesn't come from me. Cause I've studied and learned my history. It had to be something evil to bring that about. When you wake up, to a brand new day. And you think about your salary or your pay. You think of negative things, should I get involved. Caught in crime, serving time, that's problems to solve. So you think about it, say that you must quit. Smoke a blunt, then you do the same old shhhh. And while ya high you don't truly know why. You spent your cash so that you can buy. Some herb. Old E. A fifty cent Philly. so the herb can be. Rolled up modern style to what we call a blunt. Know the facts is true don't try to front. Or stray away from the positive message in the song. That's only showing and proving you're not strong. And the strong is what we need today. Why? They go the opposite way. The words right now flowing off my tongue. Is for the old, the young, the one's that's strong. Those who are worshippers of diamonds and gold. You should not be bought and you should not be sold. Those who always want but does not need. Is slightly controlled by the hands of greed. If you rob, steal, backstab and abduct. Sooner or later you will self-destruct. "

S"Used to take the 5 way out to the suburbs. Waitin at the bus stop, there was my lovebird. She would get on, sit down, scoot me over. And smile with a jheri curl restin on my shoulder. And we would hit the mall together. Maybe hold each other's hand or share a Dr. Pepper. And all we ever did was kiss, no sex. But in our defense, there was never any stress. On the phone late at night when I'm supposed to be in bed. Mama doesn't know I'm talking to Lynette. I had a lot of sweet nothing to say. You could say a whole lot of nothing has changed to this day. We was fourteen, but she had breasts. Although we was both too young for anything sexual. Just wanted her to know that she was special. She used to write me notes, do you like me, yes no?. And I don't know if it was practice for later. But both of us would break up back to spend time together. I don't ever remember trying to make her feel bad. Back then we didn't see things like that. There used to be a spot called the Boulevard theatre. And as a kid when a movie came out I would see it there. Sneakin in to the R-rated feature. I think I was fifteen, that's how I met Lisa. She showed up with a group of fly girls. So me and my crew was in superfly world. After the flick we all went outside. Paired off, took a walk into that night. I can't imagine that happening now. The innocence is gone and all the magic ran out. I wonder if my son will get to understand the fun. That comes from the summer with the one you call the one. There used to a be a fear and a nervousness. But back then it wasn't cause of domestic disturbances. It used to just hurt your heart. But now it's not enough until it rips the universe apart. Got to see a lot of love when I was a kid. Heartbreak made me wanna die but I never did. So this is for my own babysitter. Wanted to sneak out and fall asleep by the lake with ya. Smells like candy, felt like family. For every girl that ever held me in the back seat. Used to vision being love struck with em. Till I got blindsided by these grown-up women. "

She can wrap her whole mouth around a fireman pole. Suck a tennis ball through a garden hose. Low cut jeans, like to show that flesh. Baby got back like a slab of ribs. Take her home, let her meet my mom and dad. Then introduce her to all my nigs. Have a deep throat contest, you and your friends. Like the 4th of July I'm tryin to reach my peak. [Oral sex sounds]. "

S"And a city full of horns, jackhammers, and rape whistles. The alley cats manipulate the blocks with gutter magic. Today my heart beats only out of habit. Check it, it's like... My man Jus used to keep an ox between his teeth. Said he could spit it with pinpoint accuracy if there was beef. We chuckled out loud. Still the thought of it intrigued me, (right). So now I keep a jackal under my tongue to spit with related reasoning. The earthworm turbulent murder burnout Gerber baby no-brainer memoir stardom. Alarmed, pardon the old. buzz deader. Robert Crumb ugly dumb image. Barely sprung fairly numb grimace. Nearly cut cherry blood spicket wrists. (now it's like). Slide, with a millipede pedagogue pirate. Navigates city sump systems, urbanite turbines, twisted Pistons,. Termites that infect sturdy grillage. There's roaches in the pillars, spillover. And crawl across commuter-clean wingtips and loafers. Pocket full of nickels for cigarettes, gum, and milk. Bitterness, love, and violence. I'm writing a petition to have smoking as a sport. I jux germs draggin a gavel knee deep in a maggot hatchery. Operation capture flag by any means. If this means anything at all, anyway it's a riddle. Ay uh, yo excuse me (Ay Yo) yo. Can I borrow a dollar or something? (Ah sorry man) Nickel?. (Sorry man, I can't help you out dog) Quarter?. Something, man? (Yeah I only got enough for like cigarettes and shit man). Alright man, I see how it is. (I'm straight). And a city full of World Trade Center victim candle vigils. There's anthrax in our mailboxes and Xanax in my tummy. There's a single Spanish female out west traveling the country. Freak of Fantasia leak laser major. Running bases. Neighborhood watch weasels pace in ugly acres more than often. If I ever make it big, I'm gonna build a skyscraper. Tall enough to piss on Cloud 9 egos from my corner office. You can't pull the plug on a catapult (nope). Got twenty ways to tell you shut the fuck up. Nineteen of 'em are 24 bars long, the other one goes (SHUT THE FUCK UP!). Animatronic daddy long legs stay grimy up in your zoning wall,. gobbling villagers trying to hide behind the windmill. I joust riding pig-back through subway tunnels with a third rail lance. While most still try to penetrate the alligator glance (It goes). Back of the class, throwing pencils at professors. It made the Barbarellas giggle. That's when life's pleasures were simple. Now it takes a dancing bear jumping through flaming hoops. To even make em buy the god-forsaken single!. Thou shalt not desecrate the soothing spiral. Offered by a classic cut to vinyl. Find that in the Bible!. Miter saw militia fix ya up. How bout a pyramid shaped torso. With your hollow numbskull balancing on top. Now if you gotta rock a gas mask outside of your own apartment. You could pretty safely quote Shamar. Life's Ill, sometimes Life might kill. Walk into the store, same pocket, same nickels. In a city where every crack in the sidewalk's a symbol. Where there's crack in the basement. where there's krakens and slave ships. Where there's crack whores. and corrupt pigs killing cats trying to crack cases. My boombox runs on a baboon heart transplant. I got a poltergeist on a leash trained by Carroll Ann herself. Two Thousand something.... When technology ate itself glutton. Every move I make's from a robot gepetto pressing a red button. It's Vietnam in the fumes.... So I run with cannibals. that bite the hand that feeds cuz it tastes better than the food. The prickly outer shell's genetic, it helps defense mode. But it also helped to fuck up a couple of sacred friendships. Watch a six legged insect crawl out of the billy goat beard. Watch a sick makeshift bitch threat fall out when the filthy smoke clears. Watch the insect's stinger sting threat till it has sweat a bullet. Sweat a full clip, sweat a river, dead the bullshit, sail away and wither. You're the kind of cat that rolls a pimped out Caddy. Dropped with rims and limousine tints bumpin Enya. I wanna rap a lot and stack cheddar by the fistful. But for now, I walk into the store with a pocket full of huhh.... Sleepin' with squirrels... (Oh my god, What are you doing with that squirrel?). "

Waste your peoples left out in the rain, fountains of pain. Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shouting my name. Holocaust, black man whose veins littered with thorns. Back smack you so hard, all your seeds will be born deformed. Swarm dorms, sting birds,. fling verbs like mean curves. Strike three, mics flee. I infect 'em with green germs. Ringworm. cause I'm filthy and guilty, dastardly mastery. My felony melody has to be a bastard's masterpiece. Stop grafting me, chump-ass niggas eyeing me, tempt me. I'll break it down simply, I'm horrifyingly empty. Spitting darts on the tip of a glacier used for my hideout. Rock crush or German suplex, watch spines slide out. The side route. forearm bash with twenty jabs. On the ave or your lab. While I'm sipping herbal teas, verbal bees plant fertile seeds. Bitches leave with broke backs, swollen palms and purple knees. Circle thieves like vultures in deserts rest on a cactus. Got Oscar nominee MCs stuck to my hatchet. Drastic indescribable pain, I injure bars. While Bobby's throwing razor CDs like ninja stars. Chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chhhhh. drop down a manhole. I rap ammo. Drop down a manhole, I rap ammo, blows out your candle. Have Wu-Tang tagged up on your tombstone by Gano. Release the info, .44 increase your heart tempo. Scared your ass, you jumped through a closed window. Infuriate your style to that of Led Zeppelin. Encyclopaedia Britannica. Hanna-Barbera. World of Super Adventure. You're just a flicker to my inferno, we burn for eternal. MCs delight popcorn, we popping every kernel. Jot this. undermine. Federal Enforcement Management Agency. My technique be vocabulary freak. C-cyphers say my divine is like. Dante's Peak. you'll be trapped off in Patmos. Get smacked in the back of your neck with the black toast. Popping like Orville Redenbacher. or Betty Crocker. The Pop Secret is the .45 Glock popper. Control men like rats that's controlled by Ben or Willard. American Express privileges, blood spillage. We got more bars then billets. Cobra Commander. Heads exploded. American eagle stinging up Blue Beetle Bailey. Amish. that'll harness the promised land. So take precaution. Corner the market by using digital strategies. I drop bombs like Mookie Blaylock. Killa Bees must reign supreme throughout the continent. We conquered it, motherfuckers. The beat terminal. Cooley High production. Diet Coke meetings with the rich. I'm faithfully. Married to Rap, we've been engaged for twelve years. Tyson bit Holyfield's ear. we love the sport. pull up the shade. the only man out walked through Hell. Dick swinging like shit went well. Call it the mighty Joe Young. double swirl slush. She typed.

Every problem that you ever had with another man I gotta face. Started off on thin ice. Im still here but I can't skate. Slow sink, can't breath, no remorse, dont think. Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat. Queen, you deserve the title but she rejects what I give, while she nurse the wounds by them. Tried them didn't work. Got impossible standards. Nothing I'mma do is gon work. Diary of a black girl. [Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]. I wonder why, I sit and cry. Wish I could shed all these tears. Im down and out. I'll keep on moving and tryna get out. I wish I could live with no fear. So down and out. I'll keep it moving and tryna get out. Somehow. Raised by a momma who, who. Hates her baby father so, so. She dont have a problem with, with. Saying fuck a nigga quick, quick. Im just tryna be the one who never run, but you run away from me. Your girlfriends man cheat, cheat. Why not me the same thing. She can't see in me, what I see in her. This pain she inherit can't be reversed. I can't even stay living in the shade of all the motherfuckers that played ya. The irony in that is that I ain't even that, but you put it those pages. Wife, you deserve the label but, but you been hurt before so you sore and dont feel your able. Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards, nothing I ever do works. Diary of a black girl. [Versed 3: Wale]. See all I ever wanna do is be relevant. Just tell me that I ever meant anything. Or that you could ever see me and you in another light. But its like the dark women endures the darkest nights by the wrong man. And see mostly all of them have made you somewhat incapable of a first impression. What I do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna. Just intentions to impress you, if capable. Hoping that the material possesions can materialise to a better you. Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind. With such an ugly picture in it. Money, nothing I buy can buy me more time for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it. Diamonds, a girls best friend is what they say, but believe me with the right allegience shorty you gon shine anyways. And everyday that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary. The day before is better than the present. So anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences. No key for release. No reason to be around. Her minds in the clouds. She writes it all down. In her diary. "

Spread them wings and you're gonna need some landing lessons. The sun is going to burn them feathers. Lost track of time trying to ride the bender. Used to have an agenda but really why remember?. Doesn't matter when your head's in a bottle somewhere in Tribeca. Or maybe you sedated up in Silver Lake. Trying to turn a first date into a friendly game of kill the snake. Can't wait to get her face against a pillow case. Multiple choice, you can stay on that cross. Or grab it by the arms and break them off. If they buy it for you, how you not going to drink it?. If they fry it for you, how you not going to eat it?. If they throw it to you, how you not going to hold it?. Touch it taste it love it and fuck with it a moment?. Every city's the same scene, gangrene. Vampire's. They rebel to celebrate the day their martyr had fell. Now meet him at the bar cause it's part of the sell.

Rakeem is feeling lovely, word a pocket full of dough. A little drunk, reaction\'s mad slow. Thinking, should I go to the club scene. And do what? And bag a rub-a-dub queen. Another thing, beyond the cream, I wanted to get ripped. Put my lips on a blunt tip. It\'s been two weeks, since I last sparked it. Went down to the club floors. Five dollar fee, plus ID. But a brother like me, gassed his way in for free. Word, took a bar seat. Got a tall glass, of sex on the beach. Turned to my left, saw this girl she was slamming sir. Oooh, what ya do kid? I examined her. Pushed up, I tried to bag her, for her name. What happened? I didn\'t have the game. Overwhelmed, by a scent in the air. Could it be? Yes, yeah, a potent bag of sess there. It was Raekwon and Loungin\' Lo. They had a bone, you mean a blunt?. A palmetto. I said pass the bone, pass the bone. Pass the bone kid, pass the bone. They passed it, took one pull I was blasted. Felt kind of stimulated, fan-tastic. Re-approached the weak-cypher. I tranquilized her. Bagged her, for her name and address. Slid to her rest, achieved mad success. But did you bone her? Did I bone her?. Did I bone her; you should\'ve heard her moan. Outside a nightclub what? We shine some young bloods. Drinking forties right down to the suds. Ready to flow inside and rip the mic phone. Hmm, and all I needed was a sess bone. And guess who come down the block stumbling drunk. (Who?) Ason, with two bags of skunk. Pull out the blunt put the weed inside. Roll it up tight, then the flame was applied. Inhale, but not pertaining to cough. Exhale, you know like two pulls and off. Stimulated kind of toxie. Seen a girl who was foxy, yo but she needed. OxyWash, oh my gosh, yo not to disrespect. The brothers rolled up on the scene that I had known. Smelled the skunk and said "Yo pass the bone!". I said, "Lounge G" there\'s not enough to pass around. So go get a bag from Uptown. I gave a pound to the brothers who was sweating me. What about the Wisdoms? Yo they was stressing me. "Hey Genius, Genius, when ya gonna Come Do Me. Step to me, you know screw me?". Just another redbone, that I had bagged in the red zone. And took home to get my head flown. Forget about the weak-cypher, so I slid to the back. Leaving tracks of smoke stacks. That originated from the sess crops. Give me the mic and watch me get props. '

Yeah, they still play hide-and-seek. The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep. Grown folks say they should be out on their own. Before the gangs come and blow up their mom\'s home. Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fucking hectic. Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected. My lifestyle was so far from well. Could\'ve wrote a book with a title "Age 12 and Going Through Hell". I\'m trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man. So I don\'t only watch my back, I watch my front.

What is the meaning of CRIME (what?). Is it Criminals Robbing Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?. Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard. Trying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard. Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!. Shots ring off and now one of them lay down. It\'s so hard to escape the gunfire. I wish I could rule it out like an umpire. But it\'s an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist. Only the players change, so. RZA - I gotcha back (8X). I gotcha back so you best to watch your front.

Unseen hand dragging his graphite. Cross contour, little bit of backlight. Black ink after a Bristol to baptize. You can't imagine the rush that ensue. When you get 3 dimensions stuffed into 2. Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do. Being trained and observed by a capable few. Back in New York, 5 peeps and a dog. In a 2 bedroom doing menial jobs. Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod. Distractions free to maraud. I left some years a deer in the light. I left some will to spirit away. I let my fears materialize. I let my skills deteriorate. Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing. A mission that was rooted in a 20 year affinity in rickety condition with an ID crisis. Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's.... Shapes falling out of the fringe. All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings. They will chop you down just to count your rings. Just to count your rings, just to count your rings. And there were. Colors pouring out of the fringe. All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings. They will chop you down just to count your rings. Just to count your rings, just to count your rings. Used to paint. Hard to admit that I used to paint. Natural light on a human face. Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass. It was blooming addiction. Amiss in the pushing of pigment. Book like a tattooed pigskin, look. Pinhead kids of the minute. Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic. And it grew up into linseed oil over linen. Joy to the poison, voice of the resin. Capture a map of the gesture. Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure. Redo that, move that inward. Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers. Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures. Stay tuned for the spooky adventures. You can't imagine the stars that align. When a forearm starts foreshortening right. Or a torso hung on a warping spine. In proportion reads as warm and alive. Routine day with a dirt cheap brush. Then a week goes by and it goes untouched. Then two, then three, then a month. And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up. I left some seasons eager to fall. I left some work to bury alive. I let my means of being dissolve. I let my person curl up and die. Eating up his innards an unfeasible anxiety has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas. Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's.... Shapes falling out of the fringe. All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings. They will chop you down just to count your rings. Just to count your rings, just to count your rings. And there were. Colors pouring out of the fringe. All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings. They will chop you down just to count your rings. Just to count your rings, just to count your rings. I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding. Where is the truth you promised?!. "

I\'m at the Supercuts soupin\' up the wardrobe. Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones. "Hello, hello, hello, hello". Base camp, space camp. Bass in your face fuck, brace for the rain dance. Back in the back of the classroom. After a magical nap in a vacuum. Act natural, whatever that means for you. Whatever that means for you. Whatever that means for you. Before climbing douchebag mountain, I was skate or die. Started eating kale and came to terms with my lazy eye. Putting on the yoga lady, cutting off The Cable Guy. Whistle while you\'re waiting for your condition to stabilize. AV cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched. Mentholated Tiger Balm. Aleve with the arthritis cap. Irons and the niacin, iron Quiet Riot mask. Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast. 40 winks, never the same adventure. Refreshing, or the single longest exorcism ever. In the end, you gotta wonder if it\'s even worth the effort. No stairways into Heaven, you can step into the Escher. Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness. It fucked me up for eons, I wished I was a theist. The type to fake his death then forget he faked his death. Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like.... (Hey peace Aesop uh It\'s Chuck D. Yo man, you keep doin\' what you\'re doin\' man. Keep rhymin\' through those walls, alright?). From diary of dark to piety in the Ponzi. On my better days they mingle and walk off into the poppy. Had to buy some clothes that fit me. And pretend I like agave. With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him. Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars. I\'m feeling kinda done, too many moving parts. The piss-poor vision is 40 percent floaters. The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers. The friends you confessed all the dark shit to. Had weaponized the information before we could send roses. And they want a little pearl on how he got to where he at. I can\'t remember where I am, I feel it\'s probably a trap. Walk on even when the walls hug his coat. Act natural, whatever that means for you. Whatever that means for you. '

I need to know until my soul is leaving through that hole, I see Him. Up that road to meet Him and behold His kingdom. And took a number of oaths 'til they hung from a rope. Ran up before the preacher popped one in his throat. I want to leave because this place here is punishing folks. There I was strapped to a bed having war on my flesh. The priest threw holy water on me, called me possessed. I dreamed of harm and blood, rusty chainsaws, bodies in tubs. Saw men made zombies from drugs. There I was in paradise, the marriage of Christ. I saw nazarites, all gathered in white. What it means while the church at the Vatican fight?. There were flames, I passed through a traveling light, I was changed. No longer suffer the same, had enough of the pain. Felt a rush in my vein, words stuck in my brain. Saw every ancient tomb and the saints in bloom.

But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me. They wanna be me and my family too. Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room. So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies. It\'s everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me. And if you comin with eight dollars, you shit out of luck. Because the West Side ain\'t takin no shorts on the dime. So fire it up. [Hook-Outkast]. Now now now nine in my hand,. ounce in my crotch. Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!. See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains. Been doin it for years, so these niggas ain\'t gone change. Been wearin furry Kangol\'s, so that shit is old. You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent. Five dollars for a table dance so now your money\'s spent. You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk. As long as there\'s that "tic tic" followed by that bump. Cause the niggas in the Point ain\'t changed, main. You might call us country, but we\'s only Southern. And I don\'t give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another. [Hook-Outkast]. Now now now nine in my hand,. ounce in my crotch. Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!. '

S'Appeared blurred to a million true believers. Here\'s the supervillain arms dealer to the divas. Catch, amongst other world scandals. Butter pearl handles to match your girl\'s sandals. Whose flag was a black and gold patch with bloody anvils. "Hit \'Em to the Head" was the motto. When you throw blows in a knife fight, Paco. That\'s how it goes in this Modern Life like Rocko. When it comes to flows he got more than a mic full. Pull a broad like a dyke bull on a long bid. You\'re messin with the wrong kids Michael. ... it ain\'t Jack-son. A jerk well renowned for his work skill. He\'s out, the proof is the computer\'s down Urkel. MC a show via wi-fi. And paid way before we wrap it up like tie-dye. He had the eye of the tiger. through the mask like the Fry Guy. You got no reason, like short people. Whenever he walked on the street it turned glass. All the world\'s a stage, where\'s the trap door, slackjaw. What they don\'t know like Bo. Won\'t hurt Diddley squat. '

Can\'t take a threat to my new born son. L been this way since creation. A groupie call, you fall from temptation. Now you wanna bawl over separation. Tarnish my image in the conversation. Who you gon\' scrimmage, like you the champion?. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. Now, now how come your talk turn cold?. Gain the whole world for the price of your soul. Tryin to grab hold of what you can\'t control. Now you all floss, what a sight to behold. Wisdom is better than silver and gold. I was hopeless, now I\'m more hope road. Every man wanna act like he\'s exempt. Need to get down on his knees and repent. Can\'t slick talk on the day of judgment. Your movement\'s similar to a serpent. Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?. Consequence is no coincidence. Hypocrites always wanna play innocent. Always want to take it to the full out extent. Always want to make it seem like good intent. Never want to face it when it time for punishment. I know you don\'t wanna hear my opinion. There come many paths and you must choose one. And if you don\'t change then the rain soon come. See you might win some, but you just lost one. You might win some, but you really lost one. You just lost one, it\'s so silly how come?. When it\'s all done, did you really gain from. What you done done? It\'s so silly how come?. You just lost one. Now don\'t you understand man universal law?. What you throw out comes back to you, star. Never underestimate those who you scar. Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!. You can\'t hold God\'s people back that long. The chain of Shatan wasn\'t made that strong. Trying to pretend like your word is your bond. But until you do right, all you do will go wrong. Now some might mistake this just for simple song. And some don\'t know what they have \'til it\'s gone. Now even when you\'re gone you can still be reborn. And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn. Now, some might listen and some might shun. And some may think that they\'ve reached perfection. If you look closely you\'ll see what you\'ve become. Cause you might win some but you just lost one!. What a bam-bam!.... [Skit]. Teacher:. How many people know any songs about love? Tell me some titles, titles of some songs. Boy: Love. (Laughter). Teacher: There\'s a song called love?. Boy: Yeah!. Teacher: There\'s no song called love!.

S'I understand the plagues and why they shake hands with my grimace. Then remain up in my face like top to bottom train car. Let\'s question the ascension of a broken social icon and bury its domino affect. I\'mma blow this hex. over the mission. Just to administer the end-all sucker punch toward its pitiful condition. With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized. Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes. you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots. As the truth hits your ears begin to cry. "Why Is It Like This!" Why the fuck do I care?. I don\'t have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear. City lights look like bright groups of fire flies. Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies. Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries. Spit sparks speak to the streets. The skid marks are replies. Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals. The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you). As I walk out my door, step into the pollution. (I breathe in the problems) exhale solutions. Physically the situation\'s hard to stop. I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks. Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle). Abnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal). Relaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing. Faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue. Table talk, salt and pepper conversation. Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca. Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do. It goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum. Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum. Steadily searching for something new under the sun. But its stagnant, active element first of madness. Steadily searching for something new under the sun. But its hurtin,. act of development first diversion. Embracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness. The traincar used to be my apartment. Sick of people rushin in the doors before I get out. Conductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout. "The blizzard\'s coming, the blizzard\'s coming!" ?. Don\'t get worried now (We\'ve been in a cold world!). We just getting flurries now?. Yeah, its like sloooowww dooowwwn. You\'re movin much too fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass. Its delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang. But we like 1970 something 20 kliks outside Da Nang. (Dear Obedience). I apologize for the faulty academics. But they placed us in a miserable stasis. I let bygones be bygones. But tryin to see eye to eye with the faceless. Just ain\'t working the way the manual paints it. See I soak in a blue note factory. While most cats hassle bandits lamping (?) solo. And when the last red brick topples over the earth. To intercept your crooked little mess. social coma. directly to your left. Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath. Regarding how to document the shady baby steps. I bounce checks like a modern man. Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift. Together specimens from the promised land. This for the thinkers. This for the urchins allergic to they own stingers. This for the absurd verdict linkers. This for that cat at my shows that\'s always got prophetic opinions. But can\'t remember where his drink is. I\'m wallowing, shrugging I\'m plugging your corporation. Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation. Are you a memorable trooper or just a lab rat on the run. Choose one. '

Get up out of the jungle, get his daughter a bed. Get his son some gear, find a pot he can piss in. So quarters moving back and forth like it's a lottery ticket. And to be honest who gon' want McDonalds position?. No time for chicken nuggets but somehow they find all the dippers. They slipping. Elaine. Hey. I just spent a lot of time and I have eaten a lot of crap to get where I am today. And I am not throwing it all away now. Daddy, daddy was a legend. Harlem born, money gettin'.

He had all the bitches fucking all the thots. He the man, rocking Dapper Dan. I don?t understand how you kill your man (damn). I don?t understand how you kill your man.

They don't know what it's about. Just to keep you informed with the significance. How can I prove this through true evidence. Some make me laugh, think they droppin' math. Show and prove is a difficult path. In the five percent, I am the live percent. Those who perpetrate are the jive percent. I be the universal, the Biochemical.

Naw let\'s take, naw let\'s aaah shit, well I guess that about says it. I have died a thousand deaths. For kicking your fantasies overboard. I mean I\'m only one servant, making one hell of a diversion. And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed. I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs. For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs. You ever died a thousand deaths?, I have. Jonesing for home alone days to sit and count my poems. I. Dig in the dirt I rig up the earth like pulley systems. Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries. Carpet-bombers spearheading fink operetta. Walk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine. Y\'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand Sloppy leagues. And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall. Like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers. My wing span can and will employ full expansion. Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold.

It came from the heart and it went this way:. Go to hell girl, you make me sick!. I hope your new boyfriend gets cancer in his dick. What the fuck makes you think I\'d put your name on my record?. Yeah, now I feel a lot better. I ain\'t drank a forty since I became old enough to drink. Not caught up in what the fuck these people think. Cause when I die they\'re gonna find the missing link.

It's not a conversation piece, like public spectacles. Unleashed more of a clue. So when I wake up to the reigns I'll be one step ahead of you. I slide like Kodachrome. Wrote a poem for every planet. Tracked their mileage from the sun in an envelope. Licked it, stamped it. Got eight thank yous in the mail, but nine planets means there's one left. Only the earth would thank me later with a breath taking sunset. I split my lip kissing the winter. Nursed the blister in the sun. Strung a hammock between spring and where the willows turn to blood. Might of worked. Sip a little, litter it, love it. Without big beetles trying to sell him sunflower seeds by the bucket. Might of, tugboat for the boxcutter above those ashes. Without hot air balloons floatin' their four passenger baskets. And for a second taste of pain when removing that crown of thorns. pacifist huddled in subtle masochist. If I had a hammer. So my feet would stay dry when God's wine glass tilts. If I had a shovel, I'd dig a hole in the dirt. And I'll be hiding when his drunken stupor lands upon earth. anti-burden soldier to cell. And a colony of graziers. raised to justify the grimace. Ghost in a shell. forged Christ's autograph. Laughed itself, drastic catastrophe. Come the dawning of cerulean, your pity blend that we'll spit in the wind. One petal falls to the rug, she loves me not. Town crier lugging a boom box with spirit plugs. And a red radio flyer. Tied to irony like twenty burning igloos with a sailors knot. 'why if every light is dark do I continue dancing?'. I boogie for the raindrops. For the purity, the anger. For my childhood recollections. For the comic book in my heart. The mocked intentions. The clarity, passion, seclusion. Those cool summer nights. For the mark merchant across the street selling me stog's at half price. For the mights, the maybes, the nauseating pitfall. My girl, my friends. For the fact my window opens towards a brick wall. For the three legged dog I saw dragged on a leash. For the homeless man who walks my block in rainstorms. With plastic bags on his feet. See I'll throw the weight of ten Earths over one shoulder. And walk across broken glass. Through every wicked world to kiss tomorrow's morning. Not for nothing. You'll drown in a pool of your crooked morals. Whispering 'maybe Aesop Rock was on to something'. Maybe, no promises. "

As I learn with, chillin out, watching our hourglass sands. Spent Pubescent years, blessed with peers I could trust. Spinning records to a game of checkers after dusk. Laughter rushes out of mouth, clutchin my stomach, abs burning. From fast learning, not cash earning. Cause we wasn't really on 'at yet, just yes' y'alling. At this point, our lil' brainchild was hardly crawling. But had fallen enough times to keep a nigga's head strong. Fucked with enough spiders to charm a mama leglong. We's dead wrong, many days and nights. Trying strange thangs. From jane to cane and variants of the same change. Get trapped, you off map. no Peter Pan scenes. Where everythings tight and. lily whiter than Klan dreams. Pray to make cents for giving. And make sense out of living. Lord give me patience to gain wisom, please. "

And the man behind the glass just laughs. The waves come over my head and just crash. water starts receeding. A feeling comes into my heart I start believing that. I actually might survive through the evening. Survive on my own thoughts of suicide that?s competing. With thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened. By the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten. Troubled water neither one of us could swim across. I stopped holding my breath. All the halted motion of a rebel without a pause. What it do is done till you dead and gone. The grim reaper telling me to swim deeper. Where the people go to -- lo and behold, the soul keeper. I?m not even breaking out in a sweat. Or cold fever but. I?m never paying up on my debt or tolls either. I?ll leave the memories here I won?t need them. If I stop thinking and lie, now that?s freedom.

When the lion, tigers and bears'd stare at your jewelry. Thruthfully I'm content with how the day moves. Stepped up the game, oops, still rock the same shoes. And one-time with them flashin things, they still. There to turn the drama into action scenes. I'm renting me a vehicle to roll me to the finish line. Follow if you wanna, we'll return around dinner time. Back hurts a little bit more with every cigarette. My mack learned to never ignore the petty gibberish. I walk the clay cocky like Mr. Know-It-Also. Patiently waiting to pop, shake up the soda bottle. Horizontal like a mail-order male whore. That came forth just to show you his pale horse. Of course the ones that love him hate him most. Heart broken ain't nothin man, she look like she ate a ghost. Make a toast to the butterknife, fuck it right. Wonder when my butterfly is gonna kep her flutter tight. I get way lonely when I'm on the j-o-b. And every pretty face actin like they know me. Same story, take photos and blow me. Like suckin on my pony is some type of a fuckin trophy. Don't know what to say homie, I understand under. The notion that mine is at home under another man. Don't even give it two minutes of business. Rotate the shoulderblades and keep them chipless. Built a prison out of conjugal visits. Now I rock a fake grimace on my face to catch the kisses. A bag of pot luck, a pint of gut rot. Emcee's is mockduck tofu tough-talk. What the blood clot, jumpshot, fadeaway. Watch these white kids eat it up like it was mayonaisse. Then he's on to the next city followin the destiny. Fell asleep droolin on your left titty. Indeed I play my part and call it high art. Keepin my eye on a piece of that pie chart. Smarter than solutions to the rubix cube. Took it apart and then pulled out a tube of superglue. Electric boogaloo, instead of tryin to look at you. I should stay in my house, sit on the couch and read a book or two. Maybe then this space alien can uncover ways to coexist. With other homosapiens. Until that time comes people know my bum steelo. Incognito with mosquitos and dung beetles. It's like that, never the wack in actual fact. It's like this St Paul, Minneapolis jack. It's like that, take your head out of the vaginal crack.

I get drug tested before I can rhyme on the record. Remarkable specimen. With an audible weapon. Processing lyrics in less than one hundreth of a second. Beef, bring it. Bullets in barrel, spin it. After nonsense I got the reinforcements to crush any enemies offense. With a hundred thousand horsemen. The hardest muthawat, on the market right here.

Integrating you whack MC's like like MIB's with dark glasses. Asking you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed by flashing. Bright lights in your eyes with them silver cameras so when you revived you can't recall or understand it. That's how the Canibus keeps SABS on the planet. I use amnesia to neutralize public panic and take advantage of opportunities to do damage. I'll pierce you'r heart with evil thoughts. With the jaws of a great white shark that'll rip you apart. Splatter the brain matter of my enemies with the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy. In the back of his cranial cavity. With is actually what happens to any wack MC for battling me. I'm a nuclear warhead. Right now you're provoking my detonation. Never test me without proper authorization. Your brain is child's play to manipulate. I create lyrics too  intricate to imitate. And nothing about  my physical matrix is basic. I kick flavors beyond what you'r tongue is capable of tasting. You'll be surprised you won't believe you'r own eyes.

I wish this car had cruise control, so I could rest my legs. Doing hunny in a sixty five. got stopped by a copper. Caught, spotted, and radared by a chopper. Wisconsin-style, over the limit by forty miles. Yo, word of advice, trade the doughnuts in and gets some rice cakes. Back to my travels, running from my shadows. Some hitchhikers and bikers honkin' the horn. harrasin' the cattle. Hair back sticking to the seat, sweat drippin' from the heat. Diggin' through a cooler of brew, I'm looking for something to eat. Yo, there's a Hardee's at the next stop. Don't wanna, but I need ta'. Cuz I'm craving something to chase the taste of this tequila. yo girl, you got kind of a pretty voice. yo girl, what. Time you get off work?). 90 east towards Chicago, on my way to Cincinnati. I won't ever let 'em catch me, and I won't ever make 'em happy. Hide your wives and your daughters when I'm passin' through. Hometown, casting lines into the water, catching goldfish out your bowl now. And I'm as cool as the cat that came to school just for lunch. Find the talk radio station, yo, turn it up so it bumps. Don't cry, girl, I'm out and I'm a make my way east. Cause everyone in my world is takin' my peace. I need release, and I don't think I'm a find it in between your legs. Yo, I'm just joking, only going to the corner to get some eggs. So when she starts makin' the coffee I toss my bags in the back seat. And I can remember it all like it must have happened last week. How I'd rather live in a tent than bust my ass and pay the rent. But I'm eager to pay my dues,. and I'd be glad to pay the tollbooth. And I've agreed to sing the blues ever since the day I broke loose. Just like a blindfolded child walking through the toy store. Voice, not even aware that the world is my oyster. "

Keep on moving like Soul II Soul, hold the dough. Like a fool who stole pity y'all. From tryna go up against city hall titty bar. The black mic is like a red violin. Ok, everybody back to the lab, try again. Bloody rap game like leviathan. Leave a bad taste, killin my high like niacin. Stop kiddin middlemen need Ritalin. Hit me with the full tin of gin and im a kid again. Hoping all yall come in peace and its open bar. Tear the roof off this bumba rasclaat. By the end of the night spazz like shazbot. Spilt a shot made the pen lines runny. A ill plot thats ten times Ben Stien money. With more rhymes than is lines in ya database. Placing rappers in endangerment. who's reckless. With this food for thought sorta like breakfast. You could mark it off as wreck on the checklist. Wear gold fronts, can't afford no necklace. Shit, that there, could go to help them daycares. Somebody say yeahh.. (yeahhh!). Pay ya fares,... give the Herbalizers his shares. And y'all could pay DOOM in beers.. Cheers!... RZA. I came to the shores of America disguised as a pillar. The alpha and omega and the home of the beggars. the black sellers. Who been beaten, raped, lynched, robbed and stoned. And caused to roam the earth in service cause they couldn't maintain at. Home. This dates back to 1555. When they captured the first tribe of men. And piled them in a pen. Fifty feet high. They took em all on a 9000 mile ride. And landed on the shore of a place they never seen before. But read about this inside the ancient books of war. Bonded in stainless steel, stripped of their language. Still survived the anguish of slavery but still remained nameless. Separated to portions and tricked by John Haughty Hawkins. And sold on the auction, taught birth control and abortion. Rulers of the first part became slaves of the worst part. The devils cursed God and reversed God. And turned God into dog and made people search hard. No relief came to the prophet of W.D. Feraud. To a trauma, dropped our mommas off in Bahamas and Barbados. Tobagos, separated us from slave boats. Made our own brothers hate us. From Virgin Isle to Jamaica. Trinidad, Honduras, Haiti, Grenada. Bermuda to Cayman, mental enslavement. You black gods become awaken. "

When Black step in the door all hats is off. Your hands up in the air goin back and forth. I'll make it hotter than when Shaft in Africa. Jump outta a black Porshe huffin a fat cigar. Night ridin on 'em like my last name Hasselhoff. Voted unlikely to succeed cause my class was full. Of naysayers, cheaters and thieves. All it gave me was a good enough reason to leave. Cause I'm the force of the Lord, the rage of hell. You'd rather head for the hills and save yourselves. My Man rip drums. Dreams when M16's with infrared beams. Blowin up presidents' cribs with cans of kerosene. Fuck around and make your town Warsaw. I'm from Illadel the land where the killas dwell. My instinct is of a killer whale bang you up from head to toe. With lyrics I pack like a nine millimal. from Senegal. Used the mike of iron or lead. You choose your mineral. "

Seven and a half are contained. Space was my birthplace, meditate in cocoons. Now see snakes in human costumes. Call this the blind man talk, cripple man walk. See nor hear nor summon Sasquatch. It's evident per segment that unseen beings. Speak no evil, the all eye seeing. Tapping into the worlds vision with the proper rhythmic meditation. slave mental death to the treasure. Washing my robe in the blood of the lamb. Walkin through the pineal glands, like it was a unforeign land. Knowledge is the key to the mind which is a mysterious doorway. Through a long dark hallway.

S'Been shoveling coal as the engine\'s doctor. Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in the posture. The maintenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment. Was, is, and forever will be a luxury. I\'m a sovereignty columnist fathering doom document. Curs?d version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant. I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification. Sure as blurry. Stuck until my friend leaves. puppet for the plummet committee. Sputtering bum. numb enough to stomach the city. Who?s that hugging the silhouetted willows where the hill?s crest pan out?. Barter candy-coated crab apples and sugar-dipped death hand outs. I got a plan, I\'ll tourniquet my quest. Then feed a needle in the bad ending to mute the mess. When patience gallops with absentee ballots, I shove in the button. Strutting to exhibit mankind?s hostility function. with a (heave). Paling in comparison to Matthias, Goliath. Lies the rickety frame of the wicked silence. I died the day my nameless creator and I bumped eyelids. Swear to Christ we saw the same thing for a second (What?s that?). The grand mosaic depicting historical glory of the legend. Nursed me through the time stick-and-stone mixers hexed my fertile crescent. Now all\'s well, I\'m laughing on the inside I swear. Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair. My imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly. So every second of discontent?s logged accordingly. Now let?s turn mummy subtle perfection to preserve glory condition. And pray for the day a starchild tugs the ribbon. Better land a two-hand grip on that spoonful-of-sugar medical chaser. Credible crazer antidote\'s terrible, taste her. Barter with a Stolen Soul Peddler, pigeon backed feather pen. Never said a grin implied health. Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid blend of fabrics I deemed practical. Now is you is or is you ain?t compatible?. I feel the wind in my opinions. Plus hyper clutched to crush one?s gingerbread tenement awful. It?s like the day the great oak met the sawmill. A lifeline of spectacular expansion meets the reaper at the hand of one man?s tantrums. My friend?s got a book about dreams. I look and laugh. I dreamed a book about my friends and still can?t decipher the half. Chatterbox. Now let a soothsayer major cater to a kinked breed. Battered on the brink of disease. I am (skin and bones), I am (sin and poems). I am (tin and chrome). quinacridone. Blow the petals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush. And felt as if I?d actually accomplished something. Fortify the bullies, let a joke soak in the treatment. Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening. Caught a ghost up in the fuselage seconds before the cog dropped to the sticks. Oh, fashion? It?s cool and all, but what about God?. (Oh God? well he?s the man, but I mean, what about reading?). (Nah, let?s fail a pupil once a year at random to shake the academy). Well, I?ll make a waterfall out of water and autumn. their guards mimicked the vintage knuckle drag sagged in the coffin. I affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit. crooned the Old Yeller community cartoon. The carousel ballooned extravagant. Aware. Inviting, yet I?m sworn to adamant manner and saddle in worn head, thorax, and abdomen. To primitive horseback galloping. My index finger?s dressed in my talisman. Branded up in the jackal skin, I spy mark of the product. Well, one must pardon ye old common sheep detour weaving graceful through the prime directive column. Pray the virus retreats to allotted phylum. Beanstalk with a fiend walk. and my name is mud. But that?s got a ring to it, so my soil welcomes the flood. And if they raise my rent again, I?ll spend my nights practically soaked. Who spit silk dimension through the noose looped by the rafters?. After lack of reasoning, dead ?em.. (It?s like "three, two, one, bedlam"). Ooh, I?m hung. I clung to hope, but see you in hell. I?ll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt. Sturdy iron grillage, tin can skeleton. Skull of a thousand dilapidated dream remnants. Here to convict based on a tin bucket of evidence. That stairway to heaven?s merely a legend so the peasants dream well. (Bless?d peasants, bless?d peasant dream well. Every bless?d peasant?s just trying to dream well?). '

Sending customers far on a trip. And this roots of all evil brings about war. Cause you wanna open up another crack store. Children can't play in the parks and things. Because a stray bullet might be headed for the swings. You never though about that, oh I guess not. All you thought about was owning your own spot. To putting more and more people to sleep. But ya heading for a pothole six feet deep. You see the problem has gotten more serious. And the community is getting more furious. Get it deep in your head I told you so. It goes way beyond just saying no. Remember Steve with the blue Jag?. They found him cut up and stuffed in a bag. He had his own operation uptown. And there was plenty other drug dealers he would cut down. In other words he was living foul. Shootin up neighborhoods acting wild. He said he had to protect his drug trade. Which we manufactured throughout arcades. He made sure his enemies felt the pain. Whoever he felt was a threat, got slain. Like Donna, who was only sixteen. And she was employed on another drug scene. She try to set up a hit on Steve. But he sliced her throat until she could not breathe. This is what happens when you deal. You don't care on who you got to kill. I might walk outside and get shot. Because I live next door to a drug spot. And I don't need this stuff in my vicinity. Of me being shot for mistaken identity. This is the stuff that Steve was on. Now he's dead long and gone. "

In his left leg, even underwent surgery. They say his pirate limp gave him away. As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs. Now look whose on the witness stand singing, a well known soprano. A smash hit from Sammy Gravano. Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand. Half time at the game blasting niggas out the stands. The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent. Photographs of they wives taking baths. Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe. Take it or commit suicide. First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria. I want they small intestines ripped from they interior. I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo. Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo.

S'Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects. Geoglyphs on the Pampa. A dose of [?] makes it feel like a dream. The dream state is the playground for the supreme. Critics attempt to follow a trend. Today they call me a charlatan but tomorrow I will be a God of men. To create a universe all I need. Is one thousand trillion trillion degrees. Sodium 22, betatrons and a cloud chamber. Keep the noise down so I don\'t arouse my neighbors. Got a message from the Falcon and the Snowman. In an unopened Coca-Cola can. I was created by intelligent design. You are merely a descendant of the unmodified. You diss me out of pride, but when you\'re finished. Talking about money and bitches you\'re simply out of rhymes. Even my worst album was sublime. If I don\'t slow down, I\'ll distort the timeline. Back through the time tunnel to a 100 Bars again. A master like the honorable Earl of Carnarvon. The grand architect. Used to be a partisan to Lamarckism theory. but I lost the bet. No regrets, you live and you learn. Sterilize my hands to prevent catching the germs. And try to rebuild all the bridges I\'ve burned. I prefer modesty over controversy. Jealous because they can\'t rhyme like me. And they never had a scientific mind like me. I\'m above average with verbal semantics. The Aurora Borealis in the form of a rap ballad. You look at me like, "Poor bastard, why can\'t you. Manipulate billboards with all your metaphor magic?". No matter how hard I practiced, every microphone I saw. I grabbed it, obviously that\'s the wrong tactic. I went through a long period of mourning and sadness. When I wrote that Stan shit. But if you wanna see some hardcore Canibus just say so. And I\'ll come out the egg roll with seven dead scrolls. If you can find a better flow?. Then I can find a dinosaur on the Galapagos archipelago. Hey, you shouldn\'t fall for the naivete. Lyrically I\'m the illest when my beats is OK. Food for thought, nutrition for the whole brain. Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day. I\'m ahead of my time or so they say. I guess that\'s why I already feel old and grey. OK, that\'s enough knowledge for today, I\'m killing them. You better not forget it cause this is Levitibus. '

Inventor of the more dementeder flow. no bout a-doubt it. This go for if you're bout it bout it or rowdy, rowdy. Who every hooker heard of, but now ho know. The villain in the back with the x-ray glasses. Have no fear, the ninja here. Feel 'em like the tinge in your ear from drinking ginger beer. When it's on loco head gon' lay low. And heat it like beef patty, coco bread kon queso. If you say so lace the whole case load. They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show. He told 'em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's. His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halos. Say, ho, if you never worked a J-O. And keep more cash in the stash than a peso. Okay, yo, y'all know who to follow. Tie 'em up in the crib and. leave they place hollow. Oh, shoot, the goose is loose. So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice. Frown like the first time you taste cous cous. Stash the deuce deuce, troops asking truce, truce. Today on intense wreck week. We have the super villain in his own defense to speak. It's all part of my mental techniques. Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks. Train a sane brain to an insane train of thought. On a campaign trail he came to gain your support. Charge cash for a autograph. Say some shit to make your daughter laugh then slaughter the ass. See 'em on the big screen like Steve McQueen. Do something and never be back once he leaves the scene. Keep more medicated pads than Stridex. For his own side wreck with no known side effects. Before you press charges use your noodle. So what when he grab the mic he crush your cute cuticles. Keep your mouth shut, everything will be beautiful. It would be awfully rude to you, now get back to your hooty hoo. Damn it, it ain't worth the drama, can it. From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate. Soon as he stepped in he lit the room. Boom, reschedule my noon with Britt Hume. (Doom!) In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing. Pulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain. say it, don't spray it. You wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it. If I had a dime for every rhymer that bust guns. I'll have a cool mill for my sons in trust funds. When I was broker than a broke dick dog. I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog. When it rain it sure do thunderstorm. I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms. One, two, microphone checker. First learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker. This is back when he was like crib age. When he hit the stage it's like a gauge to the rib cage. Break the mic like a rock star, break a guitar. And jump off the stage like, yee haw. "

The Black Thought, ill syllablist, out the Fifth. heavyweight rap shit I'm about to lift. Like. a phyllum lift up it's seed to sunlight. I plug in the mic, draw like a gunfight. I never use a cordless, or stand applaudless. Sippin cholorophyll out of ill silver goblets. I'm like a faucet, monopoly's the object. There ain't no way to cut this tap, you got ta get wet. Your head is throbbin and I ain't said shit yet. You are now in tune to the sounds. Of the legendary, foundation, check it out, uh. the formation of words to fit. Whether they skywriting your name, or you anonymous. You be speechless, with stinging sinuses. I tilt my crown. You need to buy a CD and stop rewindin this. shinin like a rugged amethyst.

S'Yo, niggas is phony, fronting like they Master of Ceremonies. None of you suckers are even remotely close to me. To be nice, I sacrifice things like no sleep. I keep a library of lyrics on. microfiche. Creating concepts so deep, niggas quote me. They rewind then interpret my rhymes to they homies. I\'ve advanced beyond your flows eons ago. It\'s inevitable in \'98 I\'ma blow. Ever since \'84, I\'ve been in it to win it. But see back then we used to battle by spinnin\' on the cement. You can\'t even absorb the rhymes I record. Parsecs. out of range from a cellular StarTec. From the galaxy of Andromeda. I puzzle niggas like crop circles and other unexplained phenomena. Ayo, nine out of ten of these rap artists is garbage. "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded". You spineless, rhymeless, niggas is heartless. "Get re-Get re-Get retarded". Ayo, I came to see that hip-hop is never tarnished. "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded". Ayo, all I really want is you niggas to stop bitin\'. All I really want is you niggas to start writin\'. All I really want is you niggas to be original. And start spitting some lyrical shit that I could listen to. You haven\'t written the perfect rhyme yet. You don\'t even know the sequences to the Human Genome Project. You haven\'t come to terms with your god yet. And you refuse to believe in Unidentified Flying Objects. When I bomb shit, I get retarded, probably more than you bargained. I\'m talking \'bout rip a mic off your arm shit. Beat the fuck up in broad daylight with a nightstick. To the British, I\'m Gandhi. To the Japanese, I\'m an American pilot flying over Nagasaki. To the AIDS patient, I\'m your last antibody. Sitting and waiting for a cure from modern biology. Ayo, nine out of ten of these rap artists is garbage. "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded". You spineless, rhymeless, niggas is heartless. "Get re-Get re-Get retarded". Ayo, I came to see that hip-hop is never tarnished. "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded". Yo, I be looking directly into the human eye to see if you pussy. And completely ruin your ability to lie to me. Who the best is, the question will go unanswered. Till I step up, to the front line with rhymes. Revving my engines like they were powered by Le Mans. Murdering niggas with lyrics manufactured within my DNA\'s double-helix. Touch my microphone on accident and get murdered on purpose. Ayo, nine out of ten of these rap artists is garbage. "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded". You spineless, rhymeless, niggas is heartless.

Where he learned the binding of a wire hanger to rabbit ears. Every pixel that leaked dead over the carpet. Had to be spit shinned and hidden before the ford duster parketh. When mommy marched in, wrapped the broccoli in the napkin. For your electric paradisio after the parent crashes. Social retardation larvey plugged into the wall. The little short circuit with the still born vibe. Till the villagers circled and determined "it is alive". Shipped to Bellevue eyes fuzzy talking funny. Like "eagle one to grey squirrel whats your twenty dunny?. Left hand numb from the finger to the thumb (right!). Right got tubes in it, irony is fun (yaaay!!). I be the ultimate (ultimate), multi polar. Mobile medicine cabinet stocked adequate. Pockets like maracas, that will shake when he stepped. Which explains the circle of rattlesnakes where he slept. Gattaca days, Attica paper scattered. Diagonal mahogany boggled the train savage. Porn king of New York. Allergy to compassion he is the perfect weapon. Un- earth it and siphoned from Delorean doors swivel up. With aviator radar blip for most glorious titty fuck. Holy trinity, triple six, triple x,. Glutton for punishment super size me while you at it. He da:. Built hideous,silk of the milk litigant, silly wicked finicky fidget the middle digit ish. Will he alter what he feel is illy to pick at every little smidgen of integrity. As your industry bitch? NO. track the moniker. To the freight hot reaking of butter beans and harmonica. They don\'t call him anabolic Aes for nothing, OK. Dead walk sturdy, but the day I greet the worms. I pull the daisies down with me as a fuck you to the norms. Generic\'s so unappealing and in my humble opinion. Defeats a rappers civic duty to the culture. Granted every topic has been covered but cookie cutter. Delivery of simpleton wit is the real culprit. So whether street, club, battle, conscious or other. I find that interesting style can often out weigh the subject. But fuck it it\'s ace rock six records of gibberish right?. He\'s trying too hard to be weird and different right? (riiiiight). Or could it possibly just maybe be, his lessons. Can\'t be summed up in a linear set of pop culture references?. (WOW) yeah but why try, I\'m so groggy. The mach nine Ballentine ain\'t for everybody. But I will say this to y\'all that used your fifteen of fame. To mention my name, that sixteenth minute regret is fucking insane. And that\'s a longevity veteran peddling free medicine,. fuck a fork tongue cutlery,. Never wild shook but a slang that maybe alienated a couple strangers. a mongoloid fanbase that is alien by nature. Robot wars, machines hit the floor. And the simians syncopated a gigantic "encore". Alright I\'m bored, five minute bag of tricks. If you hate me you can eat a bag of dicks. ONE. '

Our survival since our arrival. documented in The Bible. Like Moses and Aaron. Things gon' change, it's apparent. And all the transparent gonna be seen through. Let God redeem you,. keep your deen true. You can get the green too. Watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do. And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm. Cause with all that?s going on I got the world in my palm. You can get the money. You can get the power. But keep your eyes on the Final Hour. Now I be breaking bread sipping. Manischewitz wine. Pay no mind party like it's 1999. But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine. Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller. Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella. Mirabella. Or collecting residuals from off The Score. I'm making sure I'm with the 144. I make salat like a Sunni. Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community. Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic. But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep. And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship.

I feel like Rockwell, somebody\'s watching me. cacophonic. Hypocrite, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit. a refugee come to your turf. And take over the earth.

[Verse 2 - Lauryn Hill]. Yeah, yeah behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes. Two MCs can\'t occupy the same space at the same time. It\'s against the laws of physics. So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics. Rap rejects my tape deck, ejects projectile. Whether Jew or gentile, I rank top percentile. Many styles. more powerful than gamma rays. My grammar pays, like Carlos Santana plays "Black Magic Woman". So while you fuming, I\'m consuming mango juice under Polaris. last tango in Paris. And even after all my logic and my theory. I add a "Motherfucker" so you ignant niggas hear me. Crew remember take notes, as I sow my rap oats. You can try but you can\'t divide the tribe. I feel no Vibe. The magazine says the girl should have went solo. The guys should stop rapping. vanish like Menudo. Took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part. As long as someone was listening, I knew it was a start. For me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp. Do a cameo while everybody do the dance. Playing Mr. Big, I\'m gonna get you sucka. While you munching at your luncheon. I\'ll be planning your assassination. hit you like the Dutchman. I compress sound sets with my rap DBX. Then drop vocals on my 456 Ampex. Bring terror to the shop of horror. As she cry, "mi amor," the phantom dies in the opera. gadgets. And kill six days a week, then rest on the Sabbath. Violence ain\'t necessary, unless you provoke me. Then get buried like the great Mussolini. And for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics.

One love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of. Laughter bats that hung from my rafters. See the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses. That clashing wouldn\'t make sense (hence my tape deck). Now I ain\'t gonna name name\'s, and I ain\'t gonna drag others in. But I ain\'t about to say that I\'m the only cat you got bubbling. You\'re lucky, somehow you managed to befriend some good people. Who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? I\'m not really sure.

He\'s actin foolish left in the middle of laying bricks. (oh we weren\'t building nothing but a great wall around these stones and sticks). Built foundation out of passion and brother dusty caskets. Studied dope rappers, vocab expansion, poems and syllable placement. You\'re just mad cuz somewhere in there you came and went (I ain\'t the type to dwell). Dismissed it as casually non compatible and bounced. Obtained status where I could straight objectively critique your after projects like.

S'Where the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold. ride strapped and unload. I seen it unfold in my area code. Just push the panic button on your remote control. got the old heads froze. They peepin outta closed windows. They not secure as they supposed I watched it all unfold. As this manic-depressin un-load with his gun hold. Guns traded for sensi and hash,. crack for ass. Entire crews pass not makin the news flash. Whatever Ave. transform to the war path. Pure wrath from North down to 24th and Task. Streets tainted with camouflage - guerilla sabotage. My cousin\'s Jarette and Todd, was livin type large. Got caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lombard. So many so-called hearts scarred they buried in the yard. Stick up kids is jumpin outta plated Dodge Rams. This is for all of my niggas, that are R.I.P.\'s. You ain\'t missin nothin, life ain\'t what it should be. I\'ll pass across soon. You remember Tauseen nigga thick slice of dream. Go out fast for the buck do anything for the cream. Never seen a case like this, although it\'s quite contageous. He even got his little brother actin all outrageous. From dusk to dawn, and from dawn back to dusk. They do anything and everything, tryin to come up. It\'s kinda sickenin, how the cash is so fuckin addicted. And when I say son wild they say that that\'s conflicted. Ain\'t nothin but a contradiction in this world we live in. Cause the loot is for the takin, and not for the givin. Then the youngest one, will say "I\'ma die hustlin. Fuck everybody except my brother who I\'m trusted in". I guess the young boy just did not know the truth. Cause the following week Tauseen threw him off the roof. kids get whacked for somethin less than a pat. Thought he was his brother\'s keeper. from the P.M.\'s to A.M.\'s. America\'s worst nightmare -- guns in kids\' hands. The year when niggas rolled with sheepskins gazelles and kicks. Even got the patent leather Adidas snatched off your feet. Strolled in the dollar house parties; in search for Cinderella. Was just a little man real bold. H-R-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow. Niggas was snatchin gazzeles and flippin pockets for the dallo. You wore your little rope chain in West Oak Lane. And niggas from Logan came to extort we know the game. You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk. And never even seen your man shot, or bodies in chalk. '

As long as you\'re not the one the bee stung. Bar fly looking for a fall guy. Taking on all types. From big baller to the small fry. Still as lonely as the number one. Cause you only love someone. So you have someone to run from. Run, run, put your back into it Sue. Always wondered what it would be like to try to rap to you. We gotta show Suzy love.

Bobby didn\'t have friends, not real ones. Just a bunch of light minded self righteous pilgrims. And they all treated Bob like the big cheese. Knowing damn well they all thought he was a "bitch please". Blows his own horn. slaps his own bass. While everybody waits for him to fall on his face. And while he\'s down, someone will take his place. If the suit isn\'t trump even seven beats an ace. Look at Bobby, he doesn\'t even know. You\'re supposed to set a new one after you achieve a goal. Accomplishments are just excuses to talk. and spit. When you music stops, who will have a spot to sit?. [Verse 3]. Bring me the head of whoever said "play fair". I want to sit in my chair and wear a blank stare. Fuck being king of the hill. When the music dies you\'ll be the first one the villagers kill. Walk in circles, dizzy up the movement. Talk in circles, the underground\'s polluted. Lots of circles, you wonderin\' where you fit. Stop the circles!. '

Zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function. But the children seem to love it. Yes mother, me and wild discovery. And heard the static flock to where I sleep. By the glow of that magic box big speaker. Stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling. Tangled in the star spangled wiring. Color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets. I want commercials twenty four-seven. I wanna shop from my bed and set an. Example for all my overworked, underpaid brethren. And lurking circuitry circus. Channel zero addict. big screen, little screen, any screen'll do. Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you.

So I can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance. Plug it in, turn it on, silent flicks better than nothing. Let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist. The viciousness, ridiculous, peaking a dummy's interest. Plug it in, turn it on, say goodbye to Sunday afternoon. It's a beautiful sight, with a most ugly intention. But I taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences. Plug it in, turn it on, never once have you talked back to me. Your majesty, I love you, I despise you. My everyday is sitcom, soaps, news, bad dramatization. "

Please put your shoes on and step into that warm weather. Go get yourself a more better forever. Gotta put it down, you gotta leave it. And don't ever come back again, you gotta mean it.

Cause I be ducking crazy spades. The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs. Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?. Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?. Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck. Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups. unflammable. Noriega. aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago. Spine-tingle, mind boggles. Kangols in rainbow colors,. promoters try to hold dough. Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so. I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th. Built with Genghis Khan,. the red suede Wally Don. I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me. Lounging between two pillars of ivory. I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece. Our poems are deep, from ancient tomes I speak. I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm. My eye's the visions, memory is the film. Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud. They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd. No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit. Clutch they fists. and throw up signs like a Crip. And throw all types of fit. I leave them split. like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips. Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building. No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children. A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence. Because you had secret evidence and documents. On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent. Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew. The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu. Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu. Or the Ebola virus,. under the reign of King Cyrus. You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris. Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil. Up boils your skin,. chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl. Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil. Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals. Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow. Rolling with the Lamb. Twelve Tribes a 144, 000 chosen. Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions. The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet. Money feed good, opposites off the set. It ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree. I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed. I'm on some tax-free shit by any means. Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM. I learned much from such swift cons who run scams. Veterans got the game spiced like ham. And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn. Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn. Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength. That made me truncate the length one-tenth. Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps. RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps. Scarred trying to figure who invented. These unprecedented. opium-scented, dark-tinted. Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues. Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused. "

Cause I don't bleed when I cut no more. A system of gods. From each of the brawling tribes. So my bible. is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged. Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells. I don't speak the language but my last laughs held. Spiraled get vertigo. Signals the flash and beep. Postin my head for myself to get back to me. Pouch full of dynamite. Blast cap anatomy. Bags full of smelling salts. Mad as the magazine. Medic, Stretcher, Call. Cracked, Crazy. Header, Fall. A threat, a break, a mistake with a pulse. Pickin' every last fuckin piece of paint off the walls. Okay the rotary corner. Grow to be notably mobile. And social gopher teeth form holes. Or any scene where Brie is normal. We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole. When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell. Burning it at both ends. Friends let's commiserate. Turn it into something to the sound that the triggers make. Born at the baddest sign. Half this time, still awake. Training all my zeros to perform like they're figure eights. 'ey, four corners of the globe All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold. Each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast. Watch them collide and explode. When I peel the blinds back. Up jump the irons call. Monkey wrench in my hands. Razor cut the islands off. Homemade taps-memories. I ignore the private calls. And ever since the 80's. I think something's in my Tylenols. Make an idolant brigade. So eager to walk planks. They will climb a tree and wait. So when the ghostly ruminations come. We'll kindly disobey it. To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks. If I had a dollar. For every time I couldn't sleep. I could buy a million locks. And finally read a book in peace. No more would my president come off as a crooked thief. killing me loudly. 99 models of fear on the wall timorous. Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks. "

You could step on and stretch mine?s to a nine times ten. I was gone, remembering though that fine line?s thin. So I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men.

It\'s James and the Giant Tugboat Complex and he\'s annoyed. (No one\'s asking you to build an ark brother. Yeah, it\'s fashion. I\'ll find my own bullies to shake a finger at. Plus this uncontrollable laugh. When those Amber Waves of Grain finally crash. Brimstone, cloned with legs and dim poems, 10 little Zen crafts. Things cooperate like paper doll participant litigants. Picket well around a burner style clinic. Acid for the basics. Ph-imbalance to burn the malice martyrs faceless. I wanna be the halo that jumps off the brain. Of the genius who decided some pictures deserve frames. (God and I are on first name basis). Yeah I call him "God", he calls me "Jesus". When I lost my religion, he fell to pieces. I keep my ghoul spirit concealed. Until The Warriors return to the Coney Isle Wonder Wheel. My mama told me there\'d be days like this, days like this, days like this. (Okay) Tell me who you chill with, and I\'ll tell you who you are. I walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar. It\'s a modern sensation on the boulevards of maintenance. To sweep your broken hopes under the rug then hug the playpen. It\'s revolution pushing through the loose pins. Of the straight-jacketed maverick classed in a bunk category. They had him parallel with a tattered glory division. Aka them who drink dreams out a thermos with a whiskey after-burn. It\'s like, 9 o\'clock wake (I\'m up), spit obscenities. My girl ties on my cape, smoke a bone, then work my deviltry. The clear day\'s laced with a classic mother nature thunder chaser set. That got my paper crane\'s wings wet. Voyeurist amendments lacked expansive coverage in the syllabus. I dance for chuckles while you man the keyhole grilling post. I done my chores according to God\'s schedule. With coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals. Metal-edged cadence that tends to repel the bevel. Kettle screeching out the operetta. I live to autograph the iron curtain with dove\'s backfeather pens spurting magma. Curs?d television earns the burdens of my Cleopatra. Disperse slap on the wrist. For the tenants lacking arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship. Sunk with a "yes sir" chained to fatigued ankle leagues beneath the angle I\'mma call home \'til the Rock meets the angels. '

Bring the best niggas to the table. I'll sic all my whales on you. I run with generals who flash Uzis in interviews. Timbs yellow like the hair on a Malibu surfer. Yellow like my Harry Winston. piss-stained concrete. Leave it right here we ghost in the Lotus. Put a package on your head,. Paying these dumb fucking D?s off with donuts. [Sample: Louis Farrakhan].

Write you a letter cause you are appreciated. I'm dreaming to be great. While working on my mistakes. You promise that's change. I'm doing the same thing. [Wale-Verse 1]. Dear Mr.Obama. I'm hoping that this letter reaches you. In good spirits. Lord knows you've been busy. But I just wanna know if I speak could you listen. We in the same city I was hoping I could visit ya. If not I'm hoping that this letter could convey how I'm feeling. First off congratulations on the win. It's time for some change to commence. I gotta question for you man. From an African American stance. Are we expecting too much from your four year plan?. And what about the rappers. That happen to act like a black president. Give us a right to be assholes?. They say your name for attention. But little to no interest after election. Or the too cheap t-shirt sellers. That's making revenue of a name we cherish. One more thing, I hope you understand your impact on our race. P.S Eh I ain't trying to nit pick. But keep them cigarettes away. I'm writing you to. Catch you up on places I've been. You have this letter. Finally got excited. But there's nothing else inside. To whom it may concern. I refuse to be another being on this earth. See I'm breathing for a purpose. I need to be the center piece of my entire culture. And I've been thinking bout you. Cause you've done such. By doing such. I get a pen and paper. Write you a letter cause you are appreciated. Like damn mama the reason I work hard. Not even my favorite rapper. You was bigger than an artist. [Wale-Verse 2]. Dear Pac. I was twelve when the gunned you. Wish you was around now to see what I've become see. In the physical or literal. Years later there's still a bunch of little you's. Never seen you as lyrical. But more as a voice that the whole culture would listen to. Speakin the truth like only you can do. Are you still mad at Biggie ? Are you still mad at Dre ?. And are you happy at the way your legacy portrayed. I'm trying to do for D.C what you did for L.A. But music today, it's getting lame for us. They chasing fame rather than making a change for us. They stop being artists, they stop being honest. They want that club shit, ain't no more dear mama's. And you don't know me. But knowin you through music is going to change the world. P.S Hey, How long will they mourn you? Forever and a day. "

Watching "BET" on jazz for knowledge on file. Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild. Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch, like we got for lunch. Chocolate fudge butter crunch. He don\'t mess with the Ritz Bits, Wheat Thins, Saltines, or Triscuits. Matzos, or Cheez-Its. Catch sugar fits every time that he sees. Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk. Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk. Even the Oreos. No matter what weather. Always kept \'em dipped in milk and stuck together. In the game he\'s shameless, even uses a code name Famous Amos. It\'s cheaper than a short stay at the day\'s inn and good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin. Give a hand to who invented the camera. Never mind the gingerbread man or the Grandma\'s. Shh, make sure she don\'t wake from her dream chill. Or get caught with a handful of cream fill. "Oh, honey! What are you doing? That\'s so nasty!".

S"follow my every step. Take notes on how I crept, I's bout to go in depth. This is the way I creep my season here's my ghetto rep. I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease. So I begin to piece my two and two together. Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet. I said subtract so shut up that, nonsense about some. solid solid. I gots in crunk if it ain't real, ain't right. I'm like no matter what the season. Forever chill with Smith. I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons. So tell me what did you expect. You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck, the the. Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating. I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting. I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more. It's OutKast for the boots I thought you knew so now you know. Let's go. All the players came from far and wide. Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides. Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day. When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day. Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah. Y'know I do some things more different than I used to. Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do. The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined. This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious. Cause the house is smelling stank the chitlins old as bitches. I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back. Getting tipsy off the nog'gen,. high as hell off the contact smoke. They having a smoke out in my back seat. They passing herb rewinding verses cause it's in the air. I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches. Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches. I'm wide open on the freeway my pager broke my vibe. Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five. It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me. Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me. Cause it's like that, yeah. Forever pimping, never slipping, that's how it is. Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks. I got the remedy, some greens and that ham. Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks. I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon. Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming. So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro. The gin and juice has got me tipsy so. It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then,. now we bend. The corner in my Cadillac. my heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat. I'm leaning back my elbows out the window. Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party. We roll deep, we dip to Underground. See a lot of hoes around. I spit my game while waiting countdown. A five fo' a three two here comes the one. A new year has begun, P-Funk spark another one... Here's a little something for the players out there hustling. Getting down for theirs. From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar. You know, niggas world wide. "

And I?m tryin to ignore it. But sometimes I get tempted to go dip and make a run for it. The thought alone makes me shiver, damn. What if I get caught? they?ll find me floatin in the hudson river. But if I escape, I?ll be in shape for my life. But they might, get my kid and my wife. See I?m supposed to make a stop. To an uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop. But I got somethin else in mind. So at the next stop sign I pull out and load up the nine. I ain?t droppin off a block of it. Then I thought of a plan. So I drove to my house and got my girl and my little man. C?mon baby, pack your stuff, get ready. Damn, why your face all sweaty?. Just hurry up, don't throw no fits. I?m a dead man walking, understand, we gotta split. I switched the locks on the door. Started packin gucci bags like I was goin on a world tour. Grabbed the luggage and the gun. C?mon we gotta go, you gotta brother on the run. Mobster: They gotta the shipment. Don: What?. Mobster: They got the whole shipment. Don: I want that son of a bitch dead, I don't care..... Now I?m drivin and I?m lookin at my passport. I?m outta here soon as I hit Kennedy Airport. Loaded the other automatic. I don?t believe this, I'm like a sitting duck stuck in traffic. I?m gettin nervous as hell g. A lincoln continental pullin right up beside me. guinea. bimmer. They drove right past, now all this chasin stuff is done. Don: I want Him dead!. I want his family dead!. I want his house burnt to the ground!. I been sleepin with the engine running all night. I started pullin on my ho. What man what? wake up stupid, we gotta go!. You know I?m headin south no doubt. Don?t care about my whereabouts, as long it?s a hideout. That?s when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side. Then the sucker started rammin' me. Then I looked, it was the Luciano family. Looked at my girl she started cryin, my finger on the trigger. Pulled it- bullets started flyin. Now I?m hittin all them bastards. I?m droppin em fast, while I blast the blood splashes. Then I finally done it. I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach. Now I?m lookin for survivors. So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver. And then I laid low. Catchin' breath the only one left was Don Luciano. So I snuck up on the sucker. Put my gun to his head, whassup now motherfucker?. He said, wait, I want to talk. I put his brains on the sidewalk. Now they no longer got a brother on the run. "

Niggas respect money, money respect power. And power, we never given unless a nigga catch, shoot or dribble. We are hopeless. Nah you ain\'t out here for the culture. You finna riot, without a purpose. You ain\'t a mothafuckin\' rider, you a fuckin\' token, posin\'. Nigga hopeless, of course not literal. But why complain about The Man when a nigga want my skin.

Thoughts take flight so fit Slug in your pipe and take a puff kid. Fuck it, I heat it like a tea pot, steam hot. Upon the roof shoot a marble with the verbal slingshot. Take aim, here I came, I'm the same. Back in '86, I'da tag my name upon your window pane. Stained the mind, a deep shade of residue. Voices within the head make choices multiple. Multiply Spawn, Slug a little buzz. And Atmosphere the scuds, cause here comes the judge. Blasted, so pass the kid a mic so we can paint this. Image of the gifted-anxious, to flip the language. It's the noun meltdown from the outer-shell. Now smell the burning flesh fresh from the hell-bound. Comin' to capture, your after-laughter. While I'm hanging from this rafter, I have to rip this rapture. Cause the cramps in my stomach, dismantle. When I tamper with your amplifier. Why try? The sky presents an eternally unfolding spectacle. One moment puffs of cumulus clouds skidder across it. And next a billowing thunderhead. Perhaps ten miles high looms over the horizon. Probing the structure of the sky. Cause I can read an emcee from front to back. From the cover to the classified, I've pacified. My mind with my rhyme skills,. I climb hills. And leap. And even if your deejay was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids. I swarm with the bees and diseases. And even if your deejay was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids. [Spawn].

Roughnecks live, for only a second. Then they give. Oblivion's what you've stepped in. Your reps token, should have been lookin'. I'm sick of you bitch-ass crews when. You tried take what's not yours but you couldn't. Take mine, your fake rhymes, spit them you shouldn't. What will it be now, another victory. Yo who will it be now, it's Spawn that emcee.

S'[Hook: Wale]. Lord, my all, what you think of it?. Been on this long road accumulating luggage. As time proceeds, preoccupied with everything. I think it\'s \'bout time I sing of nothing. Sipping wine, sipping wine, cause my Henny finished. Hard to be friendly with women who\'ve seen too many niggas. So I keep my circle small, you need reduction. Never too much friends, what is your circumference?. I swear to God, times is hard, but they\'re getting better. Tryna enjoy every moment, but see we so competitive. Gabbana made the level, and I never missed a supper. But still my hunger\'s like a fucking model at a buffet. I\'m with these broads who in love, they ain\'t seen any better. But dollar signs never mind,. and. he Cupid\'s arrow. And if my heart could speak, it would talk to freaks. And leave the room when a nigga try to sleep with \'em. Getting high, getting by, watching time fly. Tell my niggas, I\'ma get \'em if they gon\' ride. Young, wild nigga living the dream. Although I\'m not who I\'m destined to be. They keep saying, "Grow up". I pray my girl don\'t turn to my baby mother yet. But in fact I do, I need my boo to keep my shit in check. And shit get easier when dreams of chasing respect. Get realized, and ain\'t no team invading your set. Getting high, getting by as my mind fly. Just bought my homie a Roley simply to pass time. And on top it\'s lonely so keep your homies right by your side. And if life is short then we\'ll be the shorts of the Fab Five. Severed ties with any nigga who covet mine. And all the stunting got me looking ugly in momma\'s eyes. But I gotta do it, these niggas need provocative music. And as a youth momma worked too much to have an influence. Rapping and music, a bunch of bitches acting too foolish. You gotta be stupid, even Tim Allen had him a tooly. Getting high, sitting down, thinking out loud. It\'s a shame niggas lame, but I\'mma hold it down. Let my bread roll, never let my friends go. That\'s why I let these dreads grow, I\'ll never fit your fucking crown. Getting high, getting by, watching time fly. Tell these niggas I\'mma get \'em every other time. Young, wild niggas sit in your seat. Know every weekend every liquor for free. From Chilli Bowl to Phillippe, nothing so silly, bitch, I sow what I reap. Double M Genius, make these bitches so deep. I make these niggas\' opinion on younger lyricists consistently weak. Put my cardio in the audio and you missin\' the beat. I\'m out, standing in every avenue, I\'m good in the streets. Outstanding, shitting on niggas, but you sit when you pee. Hold up. [Bridge]. I figure, they don\'t care nothing \'bout albums. So why not give \'em an album about -- *chuckles*. Hey, you better sing that shit, nigga. This how you start the motherfucking show.

Blatant mentions about family blood won\'t leave. Love\'s her deeply, but evil sends it\'s opposite feed. "old fashioned". Too ever set in his ways to ever relate. If he could just set it aside, there\'d be heaven to pay. Then, weathered and aged time swept him to grave. Love conquers all? shit. I\'d say that areas grey. [Hook]. Old fashioned people they never know why. Most don\'t even know why they believe what they believe, man. Never taking a second to look at life. Bad water in our seeds, y\'all, still growing weeds, dawg. Looking at life in retrospect it\'s hard to regret. Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget. Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death. Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect. And even though nobody\'s life is ever perfect. You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth is. Pondering the purpose of living, the curse that was given. Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison. Alzheimer\'s cutting through like a lobotomy. Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas. Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous. I survived disease and political crisis. By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless. And now I live vicariously through my kids. Like people who love the sport, but can\'t play for shit. Fighting glaucoma, front the cops taking a hit. I slip into a coma, roaming over the planet. Leaving the gold and the granite, the old and the famished. But just before I vanish as I think I\'m at the end. The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again. '

Droughts and drug wars. Living by gun law. Jailcats come home and want to take yours. As a young one, growing up broke me and my peoples. Had to sell coke,. I guess we all in the same boat. 90-proof. Yo, I know a rich kid, who got hit for three bricks. 850. whip. Young blood guzzlin\' fourties hussled in a rain. Old Earth. shootin\' dope in her veins. He never had it all, the kid loved basketball. "I Miss You" written by Aaron Hall. Now back to the original, neighborhood, criminals. Clocking dollars, by the hour like his digital. Styrofoam silencers. Wildest niggas peeling caps. From Staten, where crazy clips be clappin. Slept in expensive gold spreads, threads made of satin. Labeled as the cow he had crazy beef. Seen him at the flicks. But he fucked up, he shoulda kept it real and went for kill. Cuz if he don\'t, these niggas with black barrels will. Money had slept like a nightgown. Albee Square. relaxed like he lived in there. Two kids was beamin him, them niggas from the movie theatre. One had all Guess on, lookin like he had a vest on. The other Pelle Pelle tucked with a firearm. bull kag nigga. A King Tut piece. Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out. Don\'t move don\'t even flinch. Fix em up. Drop the head, don\'t want to get blood on the Tut. burped. Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him. Granny came out blacked down with a half a shotty. I laughed, grab the King Tut head and the cash. Granny shot my man in the ass and broke mega glass. Damn, had to go out with a blast. I shot my way up out of the Albee fast.

Sleep with one eye open, finger on my pistol clutch. I got my hand in everything, I\'m real instrumental. I\'m as real as they come, ain\'t got no bitch per-tential. When I was comin up, there\'s certain things we don\'t allow. Like long fingernails, and men archin they eyebrow. Here\'s another thing I don\'t condone and don\'t approve. How all of a sudden snitchin became cool? (I don\'t know). I bump the baddest broad in the whole facilitation. All by way of mouthpiece, just by mind manipulation. I can make it look like I\'m at my best when I\'m at my worst. Persuade a broad to put on the dress, and break her for her purse. It sound like (5, 10, 15, 20 - GOUDA). (25, 30, 35, 40 - CHALUPA). Gettin money I\'m a stunna man (Gouda). In the Nike shoebox like a hundred grand (Gouda). It sound like (45, 55, 65, 75 - GOUDA). . It sound like (85, 95, wait what am I doin? - CHALUPA). A day in the life on the soil in Cali-scrillya. Take the wrong turn and these youngsters out here\'ll kill ya. The law ain\'t concerned, they love us hustlers and dealers. They wanna tear our houses down so they can build some Ikeas. Oooooh - wow! Just tryin to get my point across. Where I\'m from it\'s pandemonium and chaos. Where I\'m from the lights is off, we use matches. Where I\'m from we do it barefaced instead of ski-masks. no more talkin on them cells. I heard the fed-a-rel went ahead and bought NexTel. Oooooh - overcrowded jails. They got us sleepin in the gym instead of our own cells. put our yetti together. Me and my investors, we flippin 10 or better. I got some gouda, got a little bit of cheddar. My medallion got mo\' colors than the peacock feather. Gettin money I\'m a stunna man (stunna man). Off top, I\'m a boss, shoebox full of rubber bands. Contraband on the other hand (other hand). Big guns, big clips, kinda railroads to the man (to the man). On the realla I\'m a gentleman (gentleman).

Masta Killa cracked his Heini for him. Everybody break bread. huddle around. Guzzle that, I'm about to throw hair on your back. Since the face been revealed, game got real. Radio been gassing niggas. my imposters scream they're ill. I'm the inventor. Debut '93 LP told you to enter. Punk faggot niggas stealing my light. Crawl up in the bed with grandma. Beneath the La-Z-Boy where you hid your knife. stretch Cadillacs,. fruit cocktails. Walk with me like Dorothy. Getting waxed all through the drive-thru. Take the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible. And tell lies too, I'm the ultimate. Splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite. Student enroll. A-yo, this rap is like Ziti, facing me real TV. Crash at high speeds, strawberry kiwi. As we approach your hood, the Gods bail. Fresh cellies, 50 deep up in the city. We banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real. A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max. Hit the racks, snatch 'em up, son, twenty dollars off no tax. Dream merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurging. Rock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird. Monday night Dallas vs Jets. Two Culture Ciphers, one bag of wet. Heavy rain fucked my kicks up. Wasn't looking, splashed in the puddle. Bitch laughing, first thought was beat the bitch up. Moseyed off gracefully,. New York's most wanted cheeba hawk. Seen the yellow brick road, I stole the pastries. Same Ghostface, holy in the mind. Last seen Manhattan Chase. Withdrew the six-eight digit in the briefcase. We split a fair one,. Poconos money. Gin rummy with glare, spot the lame, bit his ear. Yo, and taste a teaspoon, 300 goons, stash balloons. Locked in lab rooms, hit with the Glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb. Clocked him like a patient,. his stocks fall,. the chain tri-color. Freezing in velour, icicle galore. Gas station light gleaming on the wall. James Bond vans. Pose for the stand-off, mad timid. Hoping that the gun fall, guessing like lottery balls, yo. "

The grip on the ghetto is tightening. You try to do the right thing? They do you just like King. Now I can hear the night scream, Sirens and Light Beams. Popping off bad shots, hitting people that they ain't mean to pop. The neighborhood?s in shock, block extremely hot. Another Black teen shot, that?s dull routine to cops. Make sure they got good grades, work the minimum wage. Now he?s laying on a stretcher, with nothing in him to save. Keep the ghetto, in whatever ghetto you at. Just don?t love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don?t love you back. You don?t live until you?ve made your first million. And top models wanna have your children. I thought I told you Wu Tang is for the children. Way before rap moved crack in your building. Yeah, now what?s the price of rice in China?. These women trying to raise the price on their vagina. Me? I?m trying to live the life and get the grind up. Like Diddy, but I ain?t trying to give the shine (Shyne) up. Poppa, pop-off no question, ya?ll dirty. like it raw, (no protection). When the kid hold court, no objection. Meth needed money at the door, no exception. I go hard in the paint on a rapper. I go harder on a pussy no Viagra. You think I?m tripping, ain?t into tricking.

But patience was your problem. So get Jacob to come find me. And religion is a style, . No fugazi, see Jacob tell you that -ish real. Hallelujah the things you do to be the manure. You never thank me at shows but you keep me on tour. Sunday services pastor is the wealthy ones working it. Preaching Armageddon while collection plates been circling the room. Fears but a tool. And Gospel gone commercial pray the purpose isn\'t cruel. And the workers in the pulpit want they blessings to improve. And they stone me on the cross and niggas stone me for the ooh\'s. And the ahh\'s foolish,. what am I who are ya. I\'m coming down from the sky cause niggas keep praying to shine. Look... amen. For the price of fame. What would you do to have em\' say your name. See I promise I would never cop another chain. But the Alms spent on these VS\'s. Got me in that complex page. For the price of fame. When that Bugatti drop my accountant stop me for a second. And said "not today, not today". For the price of fame. What would you do to have em\' say your name. It is such a shame. '

So if you get pregnant, where?s the trust?. If he got you drunk illegally, miss lady thinking that?s the way you want your seeds to be. Sad and mistreated, she won?t listen, ignoring both questions. Accepting drinks from men, expecting affection. Miss lady wants a baby but ain?t ready for the pain involved. You can tell by the TP in her training bra. Life ain?t easy but she made it hard sleazy. And her face is all powdered up like the people at her favorite ball. Like her relationship with her parents. They should have loved her and helped her reach her talents. But they didn?t, they made her feel like she was forbidden to do anything. So she thought about everything and did it. Miss lady you?re a stranger to the person inside you.

Loves in the haze of a flashback. Those that invest deeply need be gettin? they cash back. Being in lust with love, feels so dreamy. Till it?s shattered in beautiful pieces scattered beneath me. I still chase it, you gotta believe me. I just don?t think it?s as instant as an instance on tv. We try to close the distance but persistence ain?t easy. There?s a ribbon in the sky if you listen to Stevie. Problem is, my arms can?t reach that far. Or stretch that high, is it best I fly. With the wings of a goose, mixed with red bull. Awaken in a state of confusion. Dressing quickly to get back to my city. Fuckin? delusion. I?ve seen all the things that pass me by. Oh why can?t it be real?. I cling to my dreams as I grab the sky.

Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel. Through the north facility, the city must suffer. At the hand. God ca-diver. Burning desire, ebony eyes. Painted toenails, legacies die. Women by the well. Egyptian queens. Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats. Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell. Trapping they souls in realms. Baptize them with Holy Water. Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters. silent nights over Nevada. A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba. Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada. bloodhounds and hunt you down. Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor. I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly. Threatening the lives of those who threaten me. Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory. As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one. 'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols.

S'Black Panther party, nigga hold up your fist. Food on my plate, gold on my neck. Nigga lace up your sneakers and go and get some respect. Cover my body with ink, I never cherished the flesh. I struggled at math therefore perfected my craft. In the back of my mind I said "Establish your staff". Right or wrong niggas make mistakes. You shed your tears and then you wiped your face. You hold your head to the sky, you put your face in the light. Makaveli the Don, I pray I make it tonight. They never said that the odds were fair. Now we standin\' in line for that Obamacare. Pray for a better today, bring my brother home. Nigga murdered a child, what the fuck you was on?. I just wanna let my top down. But I\'m still runnin\' from the dark cloud. It got me prayin\' for some sunshine. You got me prayin\' for that sunshine. And I\'m prayin\' for a better day. I\'m just prayin\' for a better day. I\'m drinkin\' Cabernet, think of better days. Rock \'til my beard is gray like Frank Bev and Maze. In this maze they called us the black rats. Because we trap from the projects, we stack that. Hopin\' I reach twenty one, nigga black jack. Blackstrap molasses in the backpack. Dreamin\' of the pussy that I slept on, cat nap. Moon walk like Mike Jack, but never backtrack. I hold the MAC that. Them panthers and the black cats used to hold. The Kendrick Lamar Odom cause I lose control. When it comes to dope raps, yeah nigga you can quote that. Used to hold back like a masseuse. The fruits of my labor is to produce. On Netflix watchin\' Juice. I wanna 2pac the people. That mean keep \'em regal, at the same time lethal. [Verse 3: Wale]. I don\'t like to boast but they ain\'t touchin\' the flow (nope). Fuck a therapist, I put everything in this cone. My only fear is marriage she scared of bein alone. She settle for this bread so therein should be a trophy. I\'mma prolly marry somebody already familiar. VH1 10 and I\'m not thinkin about these bitches. Can do without opinions. Another brother caught up in the business. Had that lock since I lost my scholarship. I been gettin\' it to my old coach and ballin\'. Rose gold was forty, dopest nigga recordin\'. Make hoes sprint the 40. See me I thought money would change it it got worse. But its alot better than screamin "who got work?" (who got work?). From opening up for Back to packing out 9:30. I never sold crack when crack rappin was workin. With that fact its back packin and murkin. Gettin\' that Bobby Heenan while you Mr. Perfect. . [Outro]. We ain\'t posed to never ha-. We ain\'t posed to never have. '

Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping. Going from mic to mic. Well I\'ll be calling out you people like a casting call. Ah, well, it\'s wack when you\'re jacked in the back of a ride. Well I think I\'m losing my mind, this time. This time I\'m losing my mind; that\'s right. I said I think I\'m losing my mind, this time. This time, I\'m losing my mind. . Yeah, you can\'t front on that. I\'m tired of driving, it\'s due time that I walkabout. But in the meantime, I\'m wise to the demise. I\'ve got eyes in the back of my head so I realize. Well I\'m Dr. Spock, I\'m here to rock, y\'all. I want you off the wall, if you\'re playing the wall. Y\'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce. So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount. See I\'m the long leaner Victor the Cleaner. I\'m the illest motherfucker from here. to Gardena.

My name is Prince Rakeem (Today's Mathematics?). I see Today's Mathematics is being wisdom. no one there. They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken. By a brother attemptin' to open. The graves, of these mentally dead slaves. Who've been lost on a cross, for decades. And centuries, lookin' for the liberty. But receive nothin', but misery. And hard times, and things of that nature. By the devil in a genocide caper. Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep. But I found 'em, in a deep long sleep. Nine thousand miles away from home. Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone. We the people, supposed to be equal. But the men who wrote that, they was evil. Slave owners, who did not include us. They just used us, and abused us. First they trick you, then mentally kill you. And use technologies, to rebuild you. This whole plan was a perfect scam. See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man. Six is the limitation of the Devil. In the Million square miles of land that he settles. Chemicals in your head to make you look cute. They use you as a fool to deceive your own people. And fillin' my children head with pins and needles. But I'll take out the pins you inserted. And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered. And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery. To speak the truth it takes bravery. And no man could stop my flow. Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know. What, becomes of a broken family?. The inner light inside my mind's shines expands the prism. Sight beyond sight we stand up as Divine Warriors. Who smite with the mighty right hand of God. Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod. Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma. Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona. And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive. As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive. Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner. With the gold touch of Midas. who made the Holy Bible. Or Koran, how long ago,. Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital. Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head. Still puzzled like the jigsaw. "

You might as well embrace me, somehow i'm never done. Maybach Zeppelin, call em metallic plum. Or here i am back from vacation, see ya boy is home. Parading for the kid, they respect cus the cornerstone. It's so magical how i hold my own or with my brother Kamaal. [Verse 2: Phife Dawg]. There's a million MCs that claim they want some. But see I create sounds that make your ears go numb. Peace to Sayres Ave., yeah you know how we go. My best friend Steven at the Home Depot. Laurelton is in the house, I can't forget Southside. Walk past MCs like that girl did to Pharcyde. I'm labeled as the cat's meow, the MC with the know-how. Act like you know, not now but right now. Beast of the East, on MCs I have a feast. I'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice. Straight outta Jamaica, seen? Jamaica, Queens. But you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between. Now if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good. If Malik don't look good, then Quest won't look good. If the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good. But since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good. Picture Phife losing a battle, come on, get off it. Put down the microphone son, surrender, forfeit. Did I hear something 'bout a crew? What they wanna do?. You better call Mr. Babyface so he can bring out the cool in you. Or it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton. And I'll dissect you like a fraction. Oh, you wannabe top cat MCs, I'll pop you like a zit. You wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit. Big up myself every time when it comes to this. MCs be running scared as if they're watching the Exorcist. I kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead. My styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast-fed. You know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene. I dedicate this to all the MCs outta Queens. That goes for Onyx, LL, Run DMC. Akinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P. You need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other. Nuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover. Yo, Tip don't worry none you know I get the party jumping. Get on the mic and break 'em off a little little something. Yo, Tip don't worry none you know I gets the party jumping. Get on the mic my man and break 'em off a little something. . [Hook]. . [Verse 3: Q-Tip]. We got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit. So recognize me, kids memorize me. Everyday, I be scrounging, really I be lounging. I play the down low, very very incognito. Aries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme. Sometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the honeys wiggle. Intellect is the major, some heads like to wager. The skills on the hill, overlooking dollar bills. Man, you're crazy, thinking you can phase me. The Ab doesn't study mere nonsense, money. Life seems to need me, MCs seem too cheesy. With their doody ass renditions of defeating competition. I rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man. Bet your bottom dollar Vinia will make you holler. As you stand at attention, did I forget to mention. MCs will give me twenty if I sense that they act funny. Lyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant. Just mentioning the fact that the area is fat. I dwell in the under, so honey it's no wonder. That I get plenty of tail, well I even get white. I'mma bet hitting head crack, there money, take that. Breaking niggas off, cut their bank, then I'm off. While my Nikes match my Lo hat, beat joint is mad fat. Got the cutter of the box if a kid think he's ox. For tier means creator, the poetry relator. It's hemmed like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss. . [Hook]. . [Outro: Q-Tip]. Queens got a.... Brooklyn got a.... Bronx got a.... Staten Island got a.... Long Island got the zone.

S"I speak an alien argot, New York amass in his tongue. The vibe is basically martian,. I ain't the kind that use New York as a crutch, I use the force of the funk. Enjoy the work and earn my portion of mush. It's not a science, nomads crash land antsy. Whether badlands or in back of the Plaid Pantry. Stick a flag in, the claim don't fade, find shelter and await old age. It feels so strange. Now it seems to be so strange here [X2]. I got the contra spray with cupids arrows. Hitting shit I wasn't even aiming fo'. I'm not complaining though. That's the way the daisy grow. We hide away and try to make. The best of what's available. My older homies think I'm kinda sorta schizo. I feel the same of y?all, but don't consider it a issue. We can openly embrace it or be trained to mostly tiptoe. Now it seems to be so strange here [X8]. "

S"I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day. On the fourth I searched for the words to say. How to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space. On the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics. On the seventh cycle, I had to take the day off. But if it happened it to Him. Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus. There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch. I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much. The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough. I blew the fuck up, even though it was short and abrupt. I was the first rapper to ever to close orbit the Sun. One small step for man, one huge step for mankind. I am the red giant of rhymes. Solar deflectors incinerate you whole in one second. Flow is untested, those that I've threatened fold under pressure. At 120 beta cycles,  high volts ignite your eyeballs. Until you see the fire in front of you. Optic cone's rods, melt one at a time till you realize you in Hell. Rip the Jacker's not done with you. I terrorize the rap community with impunity. Blow you to pieces and move elusively through the debris. First rapper to speak over beats dogmatically. Mixed with Elizabethan drama and tragedy. My motto is to dress casually and live lavishly. Look at the Victorian tapestry in back of me. Notice the post renaissance pictures I drew. Hand sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca Peru. The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap music's tentative. Entered apprentices, this is Genabis. The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap music's tentative. Entered apprentices, this is Genabis. "

"Yeah, and I\'mma keep that shit in when I\'m comin". Fucked for thirty-six minutes and twelve seconds. "Can you hit it from the back?" oh yeah bitch no question. Turn that ass around, she had tattoos of names on her back. She said, "I keep track". I started readin her back I couldn\'t believe. I read one name it said EPMD. I turned her ass around I said no it couldn\'t be. It was the J-to-tha-A-to-tha-N-to-tha-E. Her pussy walls grabbed my dick so I\'m stuck. So I burnt that ass from that blunt hash that I lit up. "Owwwww!!" She jumped up, puffed up, started yellin. I smacked her, cracked her, put her in a full nelson. "Okay, okay, okay, okay, I give up. Besides Soopaman Luva, I think I hear my nigga". Aiyyo car pulls up, he steps up *skreech* and stick his keys in. The door opened, I snatched him up for no reason. Gave him a two piece with a biscuit, laid him out. Parrish Smith!. '

Now my trap look like black Friday, twelve AM in front of Best Buy. Haha. Niggas lookin' at me angry, what's with all the smiley faces?. My deniro like Shapiro, I see Johnny Cochran wages. I'm no lawyer, but they only bring them bottles by the cases. If you send me my deposit, I will have your city rockin'. I get the hottest beats, niggas wish that they could rhyme on it. I got the hottest watch, ain't even set the time on it. The way I'm killin' niggas it look like a crime, don't it?. I got the light, with a little bit of lime on it. Okay, now stupid ass stacks in my pocket. Whip clean, jet ski attached to the Charger. Got 'em doin' shit I know that's gon' be disgracin' they father. Okay leggo. "

Had to roll the highway just to go and get mine. And when I got it, I brought it back to you. Wasn\'t even sweatin\' you was reppin\' with a new crew. I don\'t expect you to hold your breath. You always forgive me, cause you\'re my city. To make it happen with this rappin\' is a part of my goal. But leavin\' you little man, takes a part of my soul. Believe me, daddy know it ain\'t gon\' be easy. Better this then have you waitin\' for the state to release me. I\'ll be damned, I want for you all that I never had. No growin\' up with hate for an invisible dad. Wanna hold you when you cry, tickle you \'til you laugh. I\'m tryin\' to walk a path, right now you don\'t understand. I leave in dead of night to keep from hearin\' you cry. My luggage outta sight to fight off the say goodbye. If you could form the words, I know you\'d say "Daddy, why?".

Lick the blunt and then the Phillie blunt middle you split. Don't have a razor blade, use ya fuckin' fingertips. Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in. Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end. Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip. Roll it in a motion then the top piece you lick. Seal it, dry it wit ya lighter if ya gotta. The results, mmmmmmmm....proper. That's how you roll a blunt. That's how you roll a blunt. That's how you roll a blunt. That's how you roll a blunt. That's how you roll a blunt. That's how you roll a blunt. Let's all roll a blunt. ..and get fucked up (yea). The second paragraph might makes you laugh. When a brotha rolls a blunt and his breath smells like pure ass. That's when you know you gotta take the blunt from him. Cuz his breath has the dragon in the dungeon. (yo, yo, yo, light the blunt. uh yo, here's the lighter..). I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva. And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with ya spit, shit. I dunno what dick or last puss you licked quick. And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females. That always fucks it up 'cuz they don't wanna break their Lee nails. [BEEEITCH]. You better pickup every seed of it. Because I paid 10 bills for the get ill... And for spilling it you better get lost or get grilled. Bo know everything from sports to other stuff. But I bet you Bo dunno know to roll a blunt. [Bridge]. Yo, yo, check this out. I want all the real niggas out there and the females too. If you got a fat blunt in ya mouth and you feeling high as hell. I want y'all to repeat after me, check it out. I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up..). I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up...). I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell..). I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell) Yea.

Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk. Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court. White lies and blackmail land me back in jail. We're all for sale. a stolen goal but it fail. Stranded on the front line. I shine to the dumb and blind. It comes time I take back what was once mine. Crunch time in the first quarter,. Devil's poisoning the birth water. The earth daughter rest her head on my chest. Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest. While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting. Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened. Trapped in deep water, gasping. I clash with the titans for my half on the action. I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears. Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears. You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered. You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable. One nation under God, indivisible. With liberty and justice. the mic is in my clutches. Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches. Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel. Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable. My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable. Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal. First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don. Spread it out like Grey Poupon. Splurging, merging in the suburbs. God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw. UFO spot 'em like Galaga. Holding like bullet-proof Acuras. yo Bobby. You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops. 380, spit it at you like a baby. final destination Haiti. War's extremely serious and it saddens me. To have to take things to deadly measures. And have you measured and shot for no pay. It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey. Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives. And lures MCs to the lair. With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed. Temptation tempts my victim to proceed. Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat. You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat. Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in. Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining. My mind spits with an enormous kickback. Your brain then absorbs the impact. Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback. "

And struggle for the view to clear. It's been 2 years and quite a few beers. Too many loose tears and a few souveniers. And if she only knew, how long I've waited for her. How her smiles enough to make my winter warmer. If she knew the way she walks could take away my storm. She'd probably call the cops and get a restraining order.

I\'m just a survivor of the woolly mammoth population. Bottle neck effect, sorta born def. Alien to shallow alchemy. If you gon\' metamorph the base-metal to precious. Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the peasants. I\'m floating this homing pigeon out hell\'s kitchen window. Left an S.O.S. infested. bottle nestled in his grip so. With a prayer circle release party and hearty wild bellow. I observed him fly ten feet. Then drop the bottles to the devils. Fertile circle turned fertile crescent via bad investment. Despised every second, but I guess I learned my lesson. There\'d be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system. Sticky panoramic contaminant planted. In conjunction with phantom assumption. Gutterbug alumnus candidates. Well, I promise you I\'ll man the lighthouse. Just to help guide in your ship. If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch). Godspeed, straitjacketed ragged approach. "No blood given, no recognition". Life manner, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer. Trying to build a fence around these magic beans. My dreams have gathered. But to, that certain lack of avail. I sail a choppy lot with buoyancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks). I wanna be a big bang, gotta be. Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a \'Yes sir\', sir. YES SIR!. Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn. Shoveling a big dig.

It\'s gettin\' bigger by the second. Ok, I\'m here to rock the tugboat and bid the elders farewell. I shook the buddy system wisdom \'til the similars repel. I don\'t really believe in God. But God, I\'m scared to death of God. I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans. Nor tear the pod. But it\'s like.... I hike an acre unimpressed and slept on the saber\'s edge. Enough times to splice anti-Christ\'s favorite pledge. I wanna know myself. Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves. And still my shepherd can\'t administer. The proper push and pulls. I push the ghouls to man overboard. Pull the bulls onto my sword. And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor. Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar. Got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over. The recipe\'s designed to plug the appetite for continuity. By stitching togetherness theme congruents (beautifully). I peel back hearts and lodge greed physics in the chambers. Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system. Blistering in a wishing well. BIG BANG!. '

S'It started way back in history. With Ad-Rock, M.C.A. (and me) Mike D. Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere. Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer. Riding across the land, kicking up sand. Sheriff\'s posse on my tail cause I\'m in demand. One lonely Beastie I be. All by myself without nobody. The sun is beating down on my baseball hat. The air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat. Lookin for a girl, I ran into a guy. His name was MCA, I said, "howdy", he said, "hi". He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed. Four days on the run and that he\'s dying of thirst. The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip. His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip. He said, "Can I get some?", I said, "You can\'t get none!". Had a chance to run and pulled out his shotgun. Quick on the draw, I thought I\'d be dead. He put the gun to my head and this is what he said. Now my name is MCA. I\'ve got a license to kill. I think you know what time it is it\'s time to get ill. Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer. I run this land, you understand, I made myself clear. We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin. You think this story\'s over but it\'s ready to begin. Now I got the gun - you got the brew. You got two choices of what you can do. It\'s not a tough decision as you can see. I can blow you away or you can ride with me. I said, I\'ll ride with you if you can get me to the border. The sheriff\'s after me for what I did to his daughter. I did it like this, I did it like that. I did it with a wiffleball bat. So I\'m on the run; the cop\'s got my gun. And right about now it\'s time to have some fun. The King Ad-Rock, that is my name. And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne. We rode for 6 hours then we hit the spot. The beat was a bumping & the girlies was hot. This dude was staring like he knows who we are. We took the empty spot next to him at the bar. MCA said, "ayo, you know this kid?". I said, I didn\'t, but I knew he did. The kid said, "get ready cause this ain\'t funny. My name\'s Mike D and I\'m about to get money.". Pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky. He yelled, "stick \'em up" and let two fly. Hands went up and people hit the floor. He wasted two kids that ran for the door. "I\'m Mike D and I get respect. Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect". MCA was with it & he\'s my ace. So I grabbed the piano player & I punched him in the face. The piano player\'s out, the music stopped. This boy had beef, and he got dropped. Mike D. grabbed the money. MCA snatched the gold. I grabbed two girlies and a beer that\'s cold. '

I know that you resent me cause I study how I\'m greeted. I\'m quick to touch the mic for the rep and for the loot. I\'m known around my village as the mouth that likes to shoot. Now I no longer have time for your irrelevance. Because the ignorance is just as dangerous as the intelligence. It\'s all about the passage, I\'m trying to grasp it. And hopefully my son will forgive me for my habits. I manage to pity those flavorless with shitty flows. Amped off their camp acting out their favorite videos. Save it, give me those trophies you call balls. For my display case, now walk away and save face. Fuck the beef, even you believe it ain\'t needed. I know that deep down you respect me cause you study how I\'m greeted. It\'s sewing up seams, it\'s plugging holes. Slug knows it takes more than toy flows and a B-boy pose.

I?m forever building my City of Lost Children ripping rungs off your ladder at a. Sardonic smirk.. I calibrate my mics prior to claimin' shit is rockable. Catatonic until personal practice mastered.

Come through with that gun, too. How a rap nigga make me uncomfortable?. Nigga wouldn't believe it only me and a teacher. Up in woodshop class without a tool. Just another nigga with an attitude,. slingin' adderall to a lad or two. Then when the spaceman jump man I need the loot. Short bus on the way to school, hoes puttin' this game to lose, but I came to won. Went to school with some cold-blood niggas, I ain't finna be scared of y'all, god damn. Hook.

But I ain't tryna be in wars with all of these niggas. I'mma blend in, I'mma get in where I fit in, I'mma do me. See some white kids in the hallway, they get all A's but they do E. Truthfully, as far as shootin' fives like I was 2 and 3. My record tho, they respect it tho. Cuz them group-home niggas was just too deep. And we was two deep, and it's a big difference. Niggas talkin' bout bullies I saw children on dippers. Mothers is strippers, trouble was frequent. Survival of the fittest, weaklings don't make it a weekend. And to think these rappers still tryna scare somebody. Still never hit a body, wrote a million songs about it. I'm the shit like a fully-functioning somersaulting porta-potty.

Unauthorized player, in the capitalist contest. To see who "Gets Money". No milk and honey, in this land. So it\'s play dirty or die by the hand. That\'s holding all the guns. Plunged, deep into religion was my first decision. To save me and my daughter\'s lives, but. I can\'t thrive off spirit and scripture. The picture grew clearer;. I made the move to rear her. In a life wanting for nothing. So I got into this drug thing. Sealing fates and, healing struggle gaped, wounds. Izm was just too small time. So I sold cock hits and, alleyway thigh splits for two bits. And, once strong now bony backs and stretched out. Weary racks of snatch, in other words... .. I sold crack. Morality was buried deep, beneath the new Jeep. Silk sheets and money heaps. Still the good mother, I sent my daughter off to. Boarding school to keep shit under cover. All the while envisioning myself, a champion of ghetto causes. Plus his, game I was playing, and winning. While sinning, against myself and soul to get the gold. I was the Female Don, the Crack Queen. I went buckwild, wanting more. Like the pipe worn whores I began to deplore. No time for playing with my coochie. Counting my man\'s mad lucci. While he was up inside some hoochie\'s loose piece. Taking every chance, under surveillance, being listened to. And watched, like Assata Shakur. Loose lips flipped the script. My jaded vision, busted like a cherry. I fucked and, I killed, to prosper. Upheld each tenant, of the ghastly gospel. Shift to a different Wonderland to pay the price for my vice. lillies in this field. Plenty of fat uniformed rats with. Below average size cocks that slither. Through cell locks, in the night. Lactating tits. being licked, left and right. Plenty of coochie,. burning with desire. Like black churches in the South. Black prayers and pussy on fire. Penned up behind barbed wire. Me and my fellow female mammals, animals. Bitches in cages, bodies racked with hormone rages. Just blow my head. '

But I'mma give you my word that everything will be alright. Like, what the fuck?! This phone is disconnected. Just my luck, I need advice before my love gets misdirected. Guess it's just another symptom of, just another victim of. The warfare and those caught between Sean and the Slug. Did I mention the drugs that used to make her spew forth. Carried barely half the pleasure of a pack of Newports?. For every moment I spent wishing my parents back together. Would've been better linked to preparin' me for the weather.

Makes me need a beer to relieve the fear. I wanna keep a clear sky and fly away like a meteor. Outta here maybe next year I'll reappear. I say hey there, we don't play fair.

Like I've ever left a she who wouldn't let me breathe. Instead I kept it deep enough to get you to believe. That I'm incapable of escapin' and settin' you free. Well I'mma open up that map and see the nation. Call it vocation. Call it a vacation. You can find me at the airport waitin'. Or maybe I'll be chain smokin' down at the train station.

Take it from the most slept on, you\'re wearing open-toe sandals. And I\'m looking for some new toes to step on. And one to build a rep on, you all got me fucked up.

Now me, I\'m out to get the grits, more than a little bit. If I said, "Don\'t get it Black," you know I\'d be a hypocrite. Levels often fluctuate to surplus from deficit. I, slides, AND, slips, AND, dives, AND, dips. Into it. it being grits that I gets like a quaker. But take the raincoats, for the oats. I dig my grits fixed slow. With butter. make em other. Some people call it skins but, grits is the other term. I get a little ends but, never spends loot. some immature, kids like to laugh. So they giggle for the grits and, when they get close. They start skitz-in, not this kid, because I switched in. Flipped in, changed the position that I hits in-side. I glide. Like, hittin a doobie, Thought\'ll get ya groovy, so!. Your wife\'s nice so you better keep the girls away. From the grits getter. Yeah I likes to unzip it, strip it then grip it. To be specific I won\'t lick it, so get the ticket. worm on Noah\'s Ark. Guess I haves to rest my lumber for the next number to sum. shovel\'s diggin deep. Her performance showed endurance. sorta served me. Like she was a waitress. Never will I say that she was tasteless. when I choose to move I puts my shoes on. Protection, against infection. Erect projections travels South in your mouth. Like a dentist checked in, commence to be intent. She said, "I can\'t understand you, but damn you like Prince". Zulu. By the way she roll away like a dog who name was Ubu. imprint on you dentures when I bust. Or I thrust, Mid-Atlantic, they act like a schitzophrenic. Sometimes they panic like I\'m Diggin on a Planet. Humans get picky, and judge it by the thickness. But if it bends your spoon then add some butter with the quickness. You can add some groovy spices, to give it extra. But my advice is to first let it simmer. Hot, if it\'s hot then let the pot sit and cool. Cause if you spill your milk, we label you beginner. Humans gotta know, that I keep my bowl, full of grits. Kid Crumbs. Kick a cat, but I won\'t lick a cat, I\'ll figure. I\'d rather, play the thigh kisser, sister. I don\'t die swift, and yo I\'m not a quitter. My way to the right nip and left nip then sip. grab my pack of hats. From the back,. '

She said I was crazy so I threatened to prove her dead-right. So she got court orders, restraining me, put on the red lights. Frustrated, thinking how the fuck could I clean it up. Loosened my tie, wiped the sweat out of my eyes, mixed with tears. Mind thick with fears, I\'ve lost everything that I done built for years. "Look away lady, before I swiss cheese your Mazda". Am I crazy for wanting my babies to have a father?. Today\'s about to be one of the biggest days of my life. Cause I\'m about to ask the women I love if she\'ll be my wife. I just know that she will, for this women, I\'ll KILL. I used to clean dishes at Micky D\'s, now I\'m on grill. So I\'ve been able to save up enough money for this necklace. Along with this ring for when I pop the big question. But my manager\'s been stressin\' the way I been dressin\'. Tellin\' me I need new shoes but I can\'t afford to get them!. He\'s all about perfection and does shit that I hate!. And then he threatened to take me off grill and make me scrub plates. And the toilet where people shit out all the food they just ate!. AW FUCK! I\'m starting to hear my screws bust. Let me look at the ring now to calm me down like my shrink. NOOOOOO! I JUST DROP IT AND NOW IT\'S LOST IN THE SINK. [SOS]: Wassup baby. Listen I wanna tell you something. [GIRL]: "Yeah?". [SOS]: Well, we\'ve been together for a long time and.... [GIRL]: "Uh huh...". Fatality. And make her face look like Barbecue sauce. pinto. Let off a couple of pop pops. ON THE CLOCK. I\'mma take this damn ring to the pawn shop. To get my FUCKIN money back... (cries) fuckin bitch!. I walked in on my friend with his hand caught in my wife\'s panty elastic. While she was wearin em!. Started tearin em a new asshole verbally. I don\'t think I hurt em. Dan-O! Happy Birthday. Yeahh, we\'ve been monitoring incoming packages for a while now, we noticed you have a fetish for naked pictures of Janet Reno and Will Smith CD\'s. Yeahh. No, Mr. Johnson! YOUR ASS IS FIRED!. Salespeople out front, I ain\'t forget y\'all. Split y\'all, and everybody in this strip mall. TRICK LUH DA KIDS!!. 21.99 for a Nelly CD?!. Shop owners, cashiers, even the patrons.

You\'re out in space.. yes here on Earth it\'s fun to play. I wish you were present so my love wouldn\'t go astray. And he gives what I need. Quenches my thirst when you say "Girl, please". That\'s a waste of my breath. It\'s funny to me.. that you get upset. And I told you quite often. I\'mma fill up the space.. did ya think I was talkin\'. Out the side of my neck... You left me alone, what did you expect?. I\'m dead in my sleep, she\'s standin\' over the kid. I\'m terrified, shorty was deep. I had my hand in her account. plus livin\' in a lab.

Packed to the very last rafter. Clung to the rafts and the cameras to capture the damage. Where the ants leave nothing, but the bones and the car keys. Pardon if his two feet fester, it was rude of me people, meet left and lefter. Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector. But never got his extra extra. Peace for the better but it wasn\'t entertaining. So they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven. Like bees to the honey when they lumped you up.

Look at how they bathe up in the dove blood. It\'s gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of mud mud.... Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn, popcorn.... Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn... wouldn\'t you agree that it is fabulous?. It was a lazy day, it was amazing grace. It was a half-a-dozen claymores daisy-chained. It wasn\'t daisies and crazy. Eights, it was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves. And saints. He\'ll never make it, when he aims he shakes.

S"I'm smart with it. I give it that special touch when I push it. Cause I'm also a label rep, and I can't allow no bullshit. So shush kid, shush baby! Shut your eyes. Lay your head back, shed the fear and let the tears crystallize. I wish the flies to land upon your forehead. When I extract the essence from your head. And leave your body resting Moorehead. I left more dead reputations than HIV can. But for every killing there's a reason and it's not just MC's, man!. I'm watching C-SPAN, waiting for the first state rep. To take the first step, to have to kill off to make this world perfect. Well lets get shit right, right here! Right now! Right away!. Atmosphere motherfucker! If I need to I could fly away. I'll grind you and your weak crew into beef stew. Serve you with seafood. You can't cloud my vision cuz you're see-through. You need to recognize the size of the Atmos. You ain't as tall as half this - Madness- past what you practice. RSE. you can't fuck with my tactics, you bastard. Thats why you breath fast bitch - no need to ask. We dug the fingernails underneath the skin of your scalp, then peeled it. Sent your underdeveloped pre-school style on a field trip. Now bite your tongue, this is how the mic gets stung. A whole tree to pick some fruit from, man!. You had to choose the ripest one. Your voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee. So listen please use discretion when you breath. Sound is vibration, I choose to use it with a vision. And then comes the style and precision.... No more longer will we hold your hands. Why? Cause you're too damn old. Oh yea, the network called. They told me to tell ya you've been cancelled. They also said big up for all the support. Thanks to your devotion, they now control the world. So let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of Tang. It's the noise it makes, that generates the passion I have. Atmosphere: music makers from the Rhymesayers lab. who fi me gwan test the giants when we apply this. Vice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print. The tyrants that gave you crisis, left you silenced. Don't breath a sigh of relief 'till you hear the rescue sirens. Supreme, be this team, we got this shit on lock. RSE. So you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in. You could try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in. I got you all. Wishin' I'd fall, so things could get better for y'all. But I'm tall. Area code 6-1-2, my present location.... Atmosphere...embellished with talent and the wisdom not abuse it. Blessed with insight, friends and influences. Thats what keeps us dope, what makes us dope is the surroundings. Inspiration stems from love and stress compounding. Stamina: that is achieved over the course of time. Defined as lyricist - the Atmosphericist. Sound is vibration. This sound is taken. "

There are few things that\'s forever, my lady. We can make war or make babies. Back when I was nothing, you made a brother feel like he was something. That\'s why I\'m with you to this day boo no fronting. Even when the skies were gray. You would rub me on my back and say, "Baby, it\'ll be okay". Now that\'s real to a brother like me, baby. Never ever give my pussy away. And keep it tight, aight. And I\'mma walk these dogs so we can live. In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids. Word life, you don\'t need a ring to be my wife. Just be there for me and I\'mma make sure we. Be living in the fucking lap of luxury. I\'m realizing that you didn\'t have to fuck with me. But you did, now I\'m going all out kid. And I got mad love to give, you my nigga. I got a Love Jones for your body and your skin tone. Five minutes alone I\'m already on the bone. Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own. No need to shop around you got the good shit at home. Even if I\'m locked up North you in the world. Rocking three-fourths of cloth. Never showing your stuff off, boo. It be true me for you that\'s how it is. I can be your Knower, you can be my Wiz. Then I can be your Sun, you can be my Earth. Resurrect the God through birth. Best believe. '

They ramshack the music, no control up inside it. Now - look at this, it\'s all stretched out and nasty. But - lettin money pass me. I doubt that, and niggas from the bottom now. Pumpin hard, wind sleet hail rain or snow. So... you got to get your gate right. No matter what, you got to treat your weight right. On the block if you focused on greed then. Nine out of ten times you be bleedin. The analogy is clear to all of my peers. I\'m a muh\'fuckin vet, don\'t mean to disrespect, cause. "I write rhymes, I write checks". Aiyyo what happened? {They ain\'t got in \'em to make a classic}. Aiyyo what happened? {These niggas can\'t hold the torch, so why pass it}. Aiyyo, I ain\'t bringin they names up. These niggas sound trash, straight foulin the game up. Need to change up (change up) sound so trash. When I see \'em feel like breakin they frame up. DuPont registry, talkin \'bout somebody else cars. Muh\'fuckers better step up your bars. Instead of frontin in the game like niggas really are stars. Like we ain\'t seein through the bullshit, we know who you are. I\'m like a blessing to the game when your shit sound dated. I force niggas to improve, you should be happy I made it. Here to rep the game fully, change my style like the weather. Givin you niggas new shit to make the game feel better. Oh my God, they a (uh) come ridin around. Some (uh) old dream and they (uh) can\'t get down. They (uh) lookin around outside of themselves. And they {HUH} sayin things that ain\'t really themselves.

S"A desk with a subtle light, a window, and a door;. (close to insanity). One bottle of the bluest inks your iris ever saw. One child prodigy with a vision in his core. I'm frost bitten, slippin' away in titanic burden nurses. Where the anti-hero clergy purge their value burning service. And warped was I, huddled beneath the influence of fresh. Meshed with impressions that appear to shrink before my very breath. (Breath). These tides of woe and malice and mirth initiate a wave crash. Splashing my offspring graves prior to birth, it's looking bleak. Malarky farce sergeant crooked and sleek emerald eyes glow;. OK, I strobe effects projective when I blink. So I design this chorus line. When linked we let our eyelids fall and pilots stall. With what I sing, I'll open lash light and dark clash to dim the wattage. Then see the wide-eyed dry grays, and supplied fiery Colossus. Well, I am a hostage. Guiding, yet, pushed beneath the craze's climate. Hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this. I wish heavenly brevity centered hate pedigrees instead of dead serenity. God damn. Must have remembered me. It clinched me, it wrenched me, tempted me to employ it. Apprehended me, and rendered me suspended in its voyage. How these tables have turned!. Hand to the bottle with the skull and crossbones scribbled off the label. Sip the ladle. Drank the burn. Begging for dead!. Concerns off with a zephyr tread and leg in a web. Caught triple-six couriers; beckon, they fled. OK, OK, I get it.... Let 'em shake a little, then release 'em. Like, as if ghostly hysterics would leech on band aid completion. Odium,. patience ran his anti-death commando. Just a litigant stretchin' to touch tranquil. But couldn't quite catch the angle. I'm trained as cornerstone famine trooper. So my tray within a heart of hearts still belly up and parched. I'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating. (close to insanity). The climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing. (close to insanity). Now everybody in the populace awaited my reply:. (close to insanity). I spit a billion tiny brilliant white lights into the sky. (close to insanity). Undeniably amused by the way the fuse burn. By the way the clues churn in front of my eyes.... To fertilize germination of concern for me, for we. For he who's sucked into the trench, fully dug. I don't wanna pull the plug.... Hug on my canteen like in a dream. Centipede leader speedin' through a meaty greed league. I can tell by the way the needs bleed from a seed. If the breed should have ever been bred. 'Nuff said.... Whether compared to caterpillar and cocoon. To emerge, or a spark's soon to bloom to a surge. All I need is the nourishment, the courage and the burn. To ascend from a number, to brave Blade Runner. Hunter, cleric, swordsman, king.... In the summer it rains buckets of hunger pains. In the winter it's the same, with an added climate change. The remaining two quadrants balance the polar values equally for mid-range. Yet the songs of thirst remain the same. You could turn the whole cold reservoir to liquor. Hell, split the ocean on its seams if it boosts your esteem. I never lend span of attention lest my brethren signal fresh. So do your magic, miracle worker, or I'll remain unimpressed. For the flux, the fix, the famine. For the fact that little Billy up the block obtained a lovely hand cannon. I'd examined auto-pilot (right) when filibuster won... (yeah). Concluded the few we're tuned with were now targets of his movement... (oh shit). It's intriguing. Yet, I guess, I knew somewhere, something was leaking. Now I honor instinct, delinquent. split the sun and sip the filament.... He knew. He brewed the substance just to mock the lesser budgets. Then sought off all trickery, bought off the public, and screamed victory!. Now, all hail defenders of the trash talk. I was hidden, yet I slid in just to rip the mask off. I'm seventy-six inches of all the purest sounds. (close to insanity). So y'all could dig me six feet deep my eyes would still be over ground!. "

Just drink your medicine, don't bite your glass. I tried to make a difference. But the only thing that changed was I gave you distance. I won't trust you again. Getting better at choosing friends. This time the loser wins. Cause I learned how to cut off the looser ends. I'm not tripping, this just an excuse. For me to dick down a little bit of the truth. We killing time and time's killing us. So I won't waste mine tryna grip a grudge. But don't twist it into what it isn't. Don't call, don't write, don't visit. I put you on ignore,. you're not the homie anymore. The only thing that you could show me is the door. Game over, yeah who's winning?. Save your gas, I refuse to listen. If you doing math, we doing division.

Been a few years since the last cigarette. But if you put your finger inside the flask, still wet. Stick with the fool like shit to the wool. Gotta get some tools to try to fix these jewels. Cause we don?t need to hear you sing. Of how you spent your time as king. Being mad at everything, huh. And even when we haven?t seen the sun for days. I keep squint like it?s shining right up in my face. Everyones a critic of the minutes I waste. Got me waiting in a line, got me running in place. I don?t really know what to tell ya. Say I spent too much time in the cellar. I?ve experienced a life full of accidents. Tryna write it all down before it vanishes. Wanna remember every adventure. But a percentage of ?em only exist in the abyss. Spinnin' around like the popular record. My head feels lighter than the fuzz on a feather. I try to put the shapes in order. But in case I get cornered. I'mma sharpen up the darts. I truly hold sorrow in my heart. For every heart that never got carved into the bark. I wish that everyone could leave a mark. But every part wasn?t meant to be a piece of art. You either carpe diem or fade away into the dark. While everybody else watches waiting for the stop to start. With all due respect to my liver. We tryna get as high as the little dipper. Got love for my people that survive the blizzard. But it?s a flood of liquor. my side of the river. We face pain with pain. Everybody's the same. Waiting caught in the rain. I guess that?s why I write about it. It help me wrap my head around it. No matter what the worlds tryna take from you. No matter what the world?s tryna make you prove. No matter what the world?s tryna say to you. You gotta write your way through. You gotta write your way through. You gotta write your way through. You gotta write your way through. "

Sometimes I wish that I can go back. No bills no kids just getting tore back. I want a wife, I love women. How could I front like I don't be in love wit em?. A li'l man that I can teach. A li'l sand but not the beach. I figure excess'll only bring an excessive amount of fussin. I cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose. And float soft kisses to my baby. (yo ain't that Dave's little girl?). Yeah, respect her for that. She gon be somebody. Instead of somebody-baby-mama. You see young minds are now made of armor. I'm tryin to pop a hole in your Yankee cap. Absorb me. The skies over your head ain't safe no more. And Hip Hop ain't your home. And if it is then you fuckin up the crib son. You make life look like I don't wanna live one. This God Theory overcomes the worst of weathers. As long as you willin to try, you on a good start homie. Throughout my change to grow, Some of my people got left behind. They didn't listen for the gun, as I leaped from off the line. Thirteen years deep in this marathon I'm runnin. Paid dues and still got bills to pay. When I came back around the way. Old friends gave me dead eyes. And fake smiles, half wide. We were supposed to rid the world of danger. These days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers. It's natural to fall off, just land close to the tree. And latey wanna flip grammar instead of grams. Like that's the only choice they got. But came to me to see if I could give em guidance for change. Shit y'all, I need guidance myself. And I chisel right words to make gems. Got fans around the world, but my girl's no one of em. I'm not at all ready to hear her say don't bother. And break. And this I know I can't take. Installment three. "

S'Folding under pressure ain?t get us to where we at. When all hope?s lost you battle to get it back. In fact, dark times are when heroes shine. Without them sour grapes there would be no wine. Let your ego dine, adversity for breakfast. Zero pride, in settling for less then. Fighting tooth and nail, no matter who prevails. Instead of wishing on a star grab a comet by the tail. Your ship ain?t coming in, then you got to make a sale. Catch the wind and make it sail. and hit the ground runnin?. Til ya heartbeat sound like a battle drum thumpin?. Those talking ?bout failure ain?t talkin? ?bout nothin?. You may weather the storm if you don?t stop punchin?. Reach for the stars and you might just touch ?em. [Hook: Rick Warren]. Stars shine, stars shine. When you think you?ve lost your way. Making for a brighter day a brighter day. Stars shine, stars shine. Coming out to light the way. Making for a brighter day a brighter day. Our money?s funny, our change is strange. These days ain?t sunny and the sea ain?t tame. We playing games where the rules ain?t clearly defined. In this coffee black world, knee deep in the grind. Be a vine in the shade, a salmon in a stream. Try lookin? for the stars when examining your dreams. Could go from street singers to pop figures. From block niggas to a brotha that is followin? stock tickers. To grow in the night you gotta create light. Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight. No astronomer has seen your incredible gleam. And you don?t need a telescope to detect dream. You blessed with a mind that can see through space. On dark nights, in the stars you can find your face. Just look up and marvel at all the constellations. Egyptians built pyramids from these creations. Stars shine until you?re back into the, back into the. Stars shine until you?re back into the, back into the. Stars shine until you?re back into the, back into the light, light. . Stars shine until you?re back into the, back into the. Stars shine until you?re back into the, back into the. Stars shine until you?re back into the, back into the light, light, light. Against all odds and against the grain. Sun becomes shelter in the midst of rain. In monsoon proportions them moments of importance. When victory?s in vain it?s the same the blood coursing. Of course when selfishness inside provides poison. Apply it to your life and let it sink in like ointment. Poised when them black clouds come ?round don?t back down. Let haters be theme music playin? in the background. '

You don't know who you be fucking with you'se better off, dead. Is what I say, best run the other way. In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now. My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp. Make yourself exempt. Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck. Nowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die. By getting blasted, how drastic. They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do. I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do. As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome. Step up nigga, if you want some. Ain't no thang but a chicken wang. We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane. It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies. (East Point). It's all about that cess in yo chest (it's the joint). Well nigga, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits. It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits. I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50. I used to sell dope, but in 1994. I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing. About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens. She had me making better grades to make a better life. But I never had no love or respect, cause we's gon' be alright. I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit. I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix. Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now. I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now. I call the wild because it's time to take the streets. So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat. I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal. Just an international playa, coming through your stereo. 3-5-7 to your forehead. There'll be mo' dead. cause I'm a pro, kid. But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me. My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me off my street. Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go. But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you. Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace,. pour a brew. On the concrete. remember when we ran deep. Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy. Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me. One is in the air and one is the chamber. Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger. I got the fattest dimes around my way. You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch. Just let you know, yeah. It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling. Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac. I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun. And got my pump under my seat. In case these youngsters wanna have some fun. I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this a heater. Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it. The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters. See I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers. So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you. You 'posed to be quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster. 1-2-3, you need to think about the future. Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead. From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave. You fucking slave, you better try another way. To take me out, is truly something difficult. Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke. I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip. I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped. You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do. Yeah and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking. Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas. Around the East Point way. College Park is really on the map. We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped. With the mothafucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks.

S'The priority\'s bleached since that \'76 umbilical severed. Majorities cordially abhor the pinnacle vendors. I got West Nile virus on my TV in the Bronx. I got two hollow pockets and a sleepy hollow mosh pit. Tryin to blow the spot with wet matches and bottle rockets. While cop walkie talkies squawk outside my apartment obnoxious. Tonight\'s special consists of stale fiber from shitty diner. Look mom! I learned to tie my shoes! (Hey, can I borrow twenty bucks?). Peel back the prickly cocoon to Poloroid turbulent land unit birth. Student first pedagogue only from brazen action. Wind blown mariner east river shark parry lunge carry funk endzone caliber. Watch war face painted jukies dance blissfully around a bonfire and sacrifice live sanity. Pay a nickel for nose-bleed seats in a peanut gallery. Gallop with a pegasus. Malice with no benefits. Balance with some sense of bliss and the foulest degenerates. My New Year\'s revolution\'s gon\' be to stop burning bridges. I\'m just \'gon bend \'em toward the couple cats that\'s worth the visits. And um, it\'s like that, and that\'s the way Aes thinks,. Plans are like clipper ships, if they got holes they sink. And if the skipper slips the crew shits bricks, wither, and hit the brink. That\'s why I take the poison\'s bitter sips and smile big when I drink. You never knew mayhem walked with Nikes, talked like a trucker, hawked the filibuster. Gerber baby lucid Colonel Mustards. No time to hold my breath (Nope!), I\'m only here to rap, eat, sleep, grow old, and smoke. Stoges through the hole in my neck. New millenium, mad cows and Pentium. process the hostage, lock him in the petting bin. Show him pictures of his wife and kids, then wash the brain. Probably the same motherfuckers that buffed the trains. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Must not sleep. Must bash the bracket. Pay the rent, pay the debt. Must slash the fabric. Catch the jackrabbit. Pay the rent, pay the debt. Sleep.... Roll into the city with one half of the cannibals. New joint bumpin out the whip speakers. Made the escape for a night of making tapes now it\'s back to the cockroaches and preachers. Somewhere a prom queen\'s giving birth in a bathroom stall. Hauling a prime directive not to get blood on her mother\'s ballgown. I\'m son of a stubborn old one-track jackal. Brisk, truckin\' with prime directive just to get the goods and never fall down (Raw bomber!). Ate the city, spit the bricks. Ate the boxcar, spit the burners. Ate the planet, spit the murder. Funny farm brain patient writing rap for milk money, built ugly. With a couple side effects to make\'em love me. My cipher demeanor left Jesus rubbin genie bottles. Til the following morning Colombo found a crown of thorns in urine puddles. You\'re in trouble!. I\'m not trying to save the world, I\'d rather watch it die slow. So I could spit my grand I-told-you-so. Are we having fun yet?. Yup,. step to the carnies. I checked myself in television rehab. Withdrawal symptoms may include shivering, fevers, drooling and chronic masturbation. Now I pray to the gods of pornography and Playstation (No!). Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the lord my soul to keep. And if I should die before I wake. Give my ASR to El and bury me with my mistakes. ...Bonus round. This is the hot tin roof stepper. Hold it down with centipede foundation. Mr. Greed who burns rugged obstruction in bunches. Like little Jackie paper puffs the magic dragon in dutches. We don\'t need another hero homie, gallop off on your my little one trick pony. holly hobby. Polly Pocket. pretty fuscia destiny. If the slipper fits fire up Cinderella propeller and curtsy for the munchkins right before. Aesop Rock smashed the pumpkin. iron on gusto. rustolium bloodstream. When the wrist slit it leaks out only the bloodiest bubble letters. Complete with outlines, fill-ins, dates, shading and shout out columns. For vagrant colonies to follow when redeeming bottles. You\'re a little tea pot trying to eavesdrop on the mammoth route. Peaking out from the rosebush like (Uh-huh). "Here is my handle (Ohh), here is my spout" (Ahh). Godzilla jukie. used to be in love, now out for gigapussy. Sorry to offend but sometimes life bends in the middle (Sorry!). So now you have a fulcrum where there used to be a pillar (Right). And now I got a pulse that bumps less than a cocaine binger. And now I got no nine to five and still labor days flicker. (This kid is ill)and now I got a nine millimeter Q-tip with an itchy trigger finger. See, I really don\'t feel your persona distortion. Ordered by martyrs who martyr self for martyr\'s sake. Wow fame. If notoriety grew adjacent to jealous dick-riding sentiments. I\'d give you a pound like, "Greetings Mr. President". '

S'I don\'t recall, ever graduating at all. Sometimes I feel I\'m just a disappointment to y\'all. Every day, I just lay around then I can\'t be found. Always asking "gimme some", living life like a bum. Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own. Nigga, you supposed to be grown. I agree, I try to be the man I\'m \'posed to be. But negativity is all you seem to ever see. I admit, I\'ve done some dumb shit, and I\'m probably gon do some mo\'. Why not? My music\'s all that I got. But some time must be invested for this to be manifested. I know you know but I\'m gon\' say this to you I.... Get high but I don\'t get too high. So what\'s the limit \'posed to be?. That must be why you can\'t get your ass up out the bed before three. You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out. Ain\'t you sick and tired of having to do without. Damn, what up with all these questions?. You act as though you know something I don\'t. Do you have any suggestions?. Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning. Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning. But I\'m also sick and tired of struggling. I never ever thought I\'d to have resort to drug smuggling. Naw, that ain\'t what I\'m about. Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route without any doubt. Or fear,. I know the Lord ain\'t brought me this far so he could drop me off here. Did I make myself clear?. Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what\'s said, you dickhead. See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds. My mama made me do it. but the devil, he made me smart. Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters. I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool. I used to hang out with my daddy\'s brothers, I call them my uncles. They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers. So in a sense I was Rosemary\'s baby. And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady. Hell, I treat \'em all like hoes, see I pimped \'em. Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped \'em. A playa ain\'t a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch. Smoke out, cause it\'s all about money, money, money. Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat. I hang with Rico Wade. cause the Dungeon is where the funk\'s at, boy. I\'m true to Organized, cause they raised me. I\'m also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me. Yeah, it\'s real cool, getting paid fat pockets. A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me. Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred. Like a piece of wood. and them spirits got the mutant\'s mind. I\'m getting paranoid and steady looking for the time. It\'s eight in the morning and ain\'t nobody up yet. I\'m digging through the ash tray, hoping to have a good day. I had Jamaica\'s best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head. (You got to git up, git out and git something). Now I know it\'s on, my day is finally started. break out quick, in my slick. \'84 Se-dan DeVille,. Out the Point to Campbellton Road. Everybody know about that killa that we call blow. Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit. Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog. Here come the Red Dogs, I\'m busting out around the corner in my hog. Cause I have no time for jail; fuck Clampett cops; fuck Eldrin Bell. And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country. Thinking that my city is the big lick for \'96. Hootie Hoo, my White Owls are burning kind of slow. Y\'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?. Ain\'t nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?. I thinking of better shit to do with my time. Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes. Southwest Atlanta. They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping. But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping. Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now. Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down. I dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool. Wasting my time in the school, I\'d rather be shooting pool. Cool is how I played the tenth grade. I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade. Instead of being in class, I\'d rather be up in some ass. Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass. Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies. Damn, that\'s fucked up. I should\'ve listened when my mama told me. That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later. Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention. And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with. The doper that I get, the more I\'m feeling broke and shit. Huh, but that don\'t matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST. So get up off your ass. '

Rolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94. Yeah, I\'m steady bucking muthafuckas. Not ducking \'em like duck goose. I\'m heavily strapped, yeah niggas. Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck. You can\'t hang with this, see ain\'t no thangs to this. I show no pity so take off because I\'m dangerous. I breaks \'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking. Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy. Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split. Simply means I\'m bringing the funk with the hollow tips. Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass. Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair. yeek. See I\'m a playa, got my struggle on. Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll. You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer. Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah. I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects. So don\'t flex or get served with a pop neck shit. OG, original gangsta, not quite. But maybe when I\'m locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right. Life\'s a bitch with a G-string, it\'s either in your ass or it ain\'t. I got more problems than the average Joe. So bro don\'t come \'round me with your flim flam, hot damn. Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat. Parkay. This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain....

Ghetto residents. quick to past tense your present. State of the slums, kill for a plate of crumbs. Fake ones, they\'re coarse with smiles with snake tongues. I\'m deep into this. I sometimes gasp for air. Deadly warfare, hot blocks, cops, and cold stares. Shots blare like fireworks on July the 4th. Weapons get tossed, fugitive sliding off. My forces combine, new world, 2009. Digital criminals, we make mills in cybercrime. I see the signs through a great mind. The heaviest chains could not bind. Blood drizzle, simple fact, you slept on the issue. That before you started jerkin off Joysticks and Sega. I was rocking off 100 watt amps in Cerwin-Vega. True fine tune it, ship enough units. MCs ask, "Who be those rhyme killers in masks?". No doubt, difficult task to last in the square. Beware, infinite amount of darts is in the air. I\'m victorious with no opponents and blast through components. With microphonics. Anything anti became approaching this. Our incapable love speech remains motionless. '

S'And the hype part of my imagination. Was making my homeroom a hip-hop station. Minutes before the late bell would ring. I would greet the audience and then I\'ll swing. A lyric or two as the students barked. (woof, woof, woof). cause my rhymes had sparked. Off something causing the class to mingle. To a rhythm which is now a 12" single. Letting off many styles of hip-hop. Holding the mic that I made in wood shop. Forget gold, my key chain was a cable. Two math textbooks were turntables. And for a mixer, something much cooler. A penny being cross-faded on a ruler. Measuring dope beats that were flexed. From hands that played a drum roll on a desk. From my home girl, her name, fly as Emory. (peck sound) sweet memory. I remember sitting in my art class. Drawing up lyrics kinda fast. The outcome, a masterpiece. Live shows with hyped up rhymes released. As if lyrics were flowing from the heavens above. I\'ll grab a mic and provoke a push to a shove. Now it\'s high school, lunch room\'s the scene. And I\'m ready to flip the routing. In the cafeteria, period three. And here I come with the JVC. I go in my pocket and pull out a mic. Plug it in, check one-two...alright. Now who wanna show and prove their MC skills?. A brother stepped forward and tried to get ill. But when it came time to live out his name. He kicked rhymes that all sounded the same. But I did him in with a matter of time. And he was done with one victorious rhyme. He was shocked because he knew he was rocked. Along with his classmates from off his block. YO!, I\'m telling you, I flipped his whole crew. One against one or one against two. Or three or four brothers who swore they can rhyme. Battled me and got taken out every time. '

When he drove into the back of an eighteen-wheeler. Basic leader, camp is cardboard. The jet chooses raps to advance their shark soar. Marked for M*A*S*H* out my cordial stingers.

His rhyme was very weak; I didn't know he had words for me. I bet he's probably never even heard of me. Ever since I met Stan, he took it kinda personally. It didn't even occur to me he was involved personally. With Stan earlier than me, now he's perturbed at me. I seen him on the street last week he cursed at me. He told me him and D12 were gonna murder me. And anytime that I'm ready that he's got a verse for me. Damn, I didn't know he was that thirsty for me. I guess he ain't the only emcee that's nervous of me. There ain't a person in the game wit more courage than me. From France to Germany they call me the merchant of beef. fourth album. Rip the Jacker. It's like Anthony Hopkins giving Norman Bates a nightcap. I'm 'Illmatic' like Nas. and 'Stillmatic' like Escobar. No I'm not still at it with. Todd. Don't blame me, it wasn't my fault it never was. I don't even have to make a comeback. "

S"The storm isn't anywhere close to calm. Put my face to hers clutched her by the torso. And when the lips touched I inhaled. Didn't matter that she hadn't been kissed much. It's such a shame some have a name. And everyone becomes the same. Can't help but adore each one he's torn. This one had an open window she could ask him. If someday he'll be the one to come and save her. Take her away before she takes her away. Take her away to where she didn't need to go. Life fast, bleed slow. The Godly technique. She don't love herself no more. Won't be nobody elses whore. Some see the glow but some glow is see through. Death is the cousin of sleep. "

S"I rhyme wit sense the paragraph was intense. Area's dense with the flow from the sentence. Engine powered by five hundred horses. Press by a threat of joint forces. For emcee's who spit rap to cause beef. Cause they depend on wild kill for fresh meat. On the board, you're just a piece that's captured. Weak is the land that's laying in the pasture. The plug that gave ya juice, I might pull it. Can't escape these endless waves of rap bullets. They got no place for me. In my life can't you see?. I must not push or bite it tell me. Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line). Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line son). Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line kid). Stay in line. I'm not insane in fact I'm kinda rational. Chrome-plated serrated swords slashing you. I shine light to the mic. That's filled with the unspoiled water that's rich with light. But um, you get high off the wealth and livin' large. We rely on the stealth of camouflage. Cut supply lines, flood ya mans market. From high altitude cover the land target. Lost in the desert, the journey is stressful. Where the rescues are unsuccessful. They perish while they search for it, intriguing treasures. Should of taken precautionary measures. The rhyme with the shank in the yard that kept stabbing ya. A shakedown from Alcatraz to Attica. Because we rock the jails. Wit it and mase write the verse on the walls of cells. Ya out cold, ya styles old. Allah just rolled, attack his skull wit a plan less bone. Hit ya king with a Check that caused directly damage ya disco tech. Shoulda' Protect ya Neck. And do they think they got me? I don't know. They seen ya picture baby? Don't think so. Now do your mission and while you were thinking. Ain't no collision that'll stop me from screaming. Involving movements, controlling the squares that's closed in. Wit impact, in fact ya zone is frozen. Submerged in deep blocks of ice. Sceaming a wise by the high-tech devise. The slightest fame can bring pain and torture. The author, who came with a burning offer. Published by whoever made it must own it. Is just symatomic for one chaotic moment. "

S'That would be a unpardonable breach of confidence for me to reveal. He said "One of these days, all eyes would be on me. When they look up in the sky and see the neon C". Rhymes inscribed on a nickel disk encased. In glass with an ion beam for longevity. For more than 10 centuries, impressions and memories. The first time machine inventor will mention me. Canibus was a visionary indeed. He believed light could travel in multiples of C. The organic supercomputer that solved. the mysteries. Of Klein Kaluza. with two blue metric rulers. Liked Cool J, but thought Stephen Jay Gould was cooler. And he never liked to propagate rumors. Canary Island cigars. He had a strong mind, he used to philosophize. About rhymes while he was. pruning his bonsai. He claimed that he had written the greatest rhyme of all time. But he would never take it out his archives. He wrote 2 songs per day. And was constantly experimenting with his wordplay. In his youth he did a report on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. He got an F but he deserved an A. I followed his career from the first day. It seemed a lack of support contributed to his inert ways. I seen him pull in 24 hour workdays. With deferred pay, undeterred by the word "shame". Public humiliation was the worst pain. He was spinning out of control like a class 5 hurricane. He said he wouldn\'t want another MC to suffer the same. Especially when there\'s nothing to gain. He was the illest alive but nobody would face it. He spit until his tongue was too torched to taste it. Properly funded corporations. carbon dated his latest creations. To extract the information. They found it utterly amazing. They claimed the body of his work was the same thing as a priceless painting. Never mattered to him that art galleries hated him. Cause Thomas Kinkade called and said he would take 10. Complete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language. With sound but without shape or signature. Kept files in his garage on MS-DOS. In a fire-proof pod, he thought it was odd. Outside there was a shed with an Oppenheimer lock. He apparently kept more wax then Madame Tussaud\'s. We were in total awe, cause it blew our minds. So many rhymes that were intricately designed. He was Poet Laureate of his time. And if you don\'t mind, I\'d like to share some of his rhymes. One should not assume the philosophy of David Hume. Is nothing more then a subjective conclusion. The runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin. Affects the population fluctuation. On a continuous basis but that\'s just the basics. The juxtaposition of Canibus\'s position. The precision of something no other has written. Way above and beyond what was intended. The unparalleled malleable enunciation of a sentence. You didn\'t go to college obviously. I can tell by your ungodly unintelligible terminology. the rhymes of modern speeds. When the brain orders the body not to breathe. Your competency is not up to speed, you\'re not in my league. Allow me to speak figuratively, nigga please. My intellectual properties are about the size of Greece. Your counselor advised you not to speak. My counselor advised me to keep rhyming until they stopped the beat. In the words of Joseph Heller, "I learned how to write better". Even though it sort of irked me. He said he didn\'t understand the process of the imagination. But he felt he was at its mercy. Which explains my point perfectly and certainly reinforces. The reason why nobody\'s probably ever heard of me. Couldn\'t understand what I mean by ill. Unless you try to translate what I print to film. This is the line of will, the circle of time. The cycle of eternity, the emergence of 1 line. Academic phonetics render critics tongue-tied. I\'ve personified dry humor of cum laude alumni. A wise man sees failure as progress. A fool divorces his knowledge and misses the logic. And loses his soul in the process. Obsessed with nonsense with a caricature that has no content. My style is masterful, multilateral. I could battle a fool and be naturally cruel. Words of scorn are a disastrous tool. From an existentialist\'s view I\'m a better rapper than you. Grab the mic and rip your physical fabric in 2. Different methods interpreted into different forms. From entirely different perceptions and seen from different norms. Not to spit in the palm there\'s much more involved. There\'s much more pieces of the puzzle for you to solve. 48 orders of mechanical laws. And rays of creational cause, enhance the cadence of my bars. Maybe I am self-absorbed. But that\'s the effect, to find the cause you should ask my A&R. Today is what it is, but only because yesterday was what it was. Permitting you heard of Beezlebub. A tale of demons. and drugs, pissy drunk in the club. With the DJ doing the needle rub. Chances are you\'ll never see me son. Yeah I know my name\'s Canibus but I can\'t help you if you need a dub. I\'m so nice on the mic, they want to beat me up. Its deep as fuck, I ain\'t seen it all but I\'ve seen enough. Really unbelievable stuff. There\'s a lot of times when I want to speak but I\'m stuck. I should leave this rap shit alone. And kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home. My imagination is my own. The liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone. With a pen in my hand, I bring motion to the enneagram. Been spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began. Trying to escape the wicked empire of Def Jam. And the land where lyrics are bland and heretics hang. Every warrior has an axe to bury. But he has to learn to discern between enemy and adversary. "Germaine this is insane. It\'s suicide its controlled flight into terrain". I fought to regain control of the plain, but went up in a ball of flames. And got banned from the hip-hop hall of fame. For two bars I kept hearing in my head. Over and over again, it cost me everything. Where people create language that pretends to communicate. Euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes. But its a bi-product of the ghetto music we make. From an extroverted point of view I think its too late. Hip Hop has never been the same since \'88. Since it became a lucrative profession. There\'s a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression. Even though the potency of it lessens. Big money industries writing checks to suppress the question. And nobody gives a fuck no more, no one goes to the book store. Ever since the confluence of Moore\'s Law. But I stay in the lab like Niels Bohr. His son Aage. and Leo Szilard. Lyrically I take rap music and turn the knob. To the right full throttle. Sometimes I say things I myself can\'t believe. My lyrical is so skillfully elliptical. I can understand how it makes you miserable. You wonder why I never let you play your beats for me. Or why I keep my studio enshrouded in secrecy. You wonder whats my infatuation with Alicia Keys. "Canibus why don\'t you speak to me?". Yo, I meant it when I said no one can shine on a song that features me. That\'s why I said it so vehemently. You need to replace the hate with respect. I\'m probably the best yet, Poet Laureate. '

Infactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers. Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers. The monkey on her back is now a gorilla. Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's gon' kill her. The clinic didn't help (nope). Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?. I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching. So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle. Tie a sock around her arm and start shooting up the diesel. The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack. A regular John, she met him through Tom. Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around. With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases. You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?. All of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road.

S'I?m better off looking for the end. Where the credits are. It?s a pain living life against the grain. I?m looking back and y?all look the same. Troy, Mark, and little what?s his name. Memory is rerunning it all. It?s the flight of my fall. and it?s right on the wall. I used to ride the train to the same two stops. And look at the graffiti on the rooftops. Like the same song playing on the jukebox. Joint called ?Faded Polaroids In A Shoebox?. Regardless to what the cadence is. It can?t be forgotten like old acquaintances. I realize how depressing of a place it is. And when I notice my reflection whose face it is. [Interlude: Instrumental]. It?s only human to express the way you really feel. But that same humanity is my Achilles? heel. A leopard can?t change its spots and never will. So I?m forever ill. What?s keeping me from breaking out like Benadryl. When my baptism of fire resulted in a kill. Sometimes it?s as cut and dry as a business deal. You gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill. But you remember still. '

We can make war or make babies. Back when I was nothing. You made a brother feel like he was something. That's why I'm with you to this day boo no fronting. Even when the skies were gray. You would rub me on my back and say, baby it'll be okay. Now that's real to a brother like me baby. Never ever give my cootie away and keep it tight aight. And I'mma walk these dogs so we can live. In a fat-ass crib with thousands of kids. you don't need a ring to be my wife. Just be there for me and I'mma make sure we be. Living in the effin lap of luxury. I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk with me. But you did, now I'm going all out kid. And I got mad love to give, you my nigga. Like sweet morning dew. I took one look at you. And it was plain to see. You were my destiny. With you I'll spend my time. I'll dedicate my life, I'll sacrifice for you. Dedicate my life to you. I got a Love Jones for your body and your skin tone. Five minutes alone, I'm already on the bone. Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own. No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home. Even if I'm locked up North you in the world. Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showing your stuff off, boo. It be true me for you, that's how it is. I be your knower, you be my Wiz. I'm your Mister, you my Misses with hugs and kisses. Valentine cards and birthday wishes, please. We on another level of planning, of understanding. The bond between man and woman, and child. The highest elevation, cause we above.

See this where he begin to know that where he come from. See some people don't have no direction, God. Because they don't know the science of they self. See the signs of life is the signs of you. All the elements that it took to create you. Everything that's in the universe, God. That's created the universe, God, is just within you. You see what I'm sayin?. And that's the mind that you can't see. Don't you know if a man could take and flip himself inside out, God. He'll fall out and die if he sees the shit that goes on...inside?. So you mean to tell me I'm the creator of all this right here?. You the creator of all this. Because all these things must happen, it must take place. See people go back in the day, God. They say: one man, one woman, Adam and Eve, there ain't no such thing. Everything you see always has been and always will what be. Regardless the womb or what, it's got to be. this shit be off the noggin. Whatever cock block it. Cat get blown, who own this street corner. Foreigner hesitate to rock a Hummer. Navy Seal top runner. For real, marinating nigga's skating. Fine line switch it on ya, like venetian blinds. king I divine. Titanium Hydro collide though. Slang doctor, medicated kids pay it. 5-G consigner. line for liner. Poet designer,. sharp like Linus. Mic of the year award. fly gear award. Them niggas over there be analyzing with one sword.

Gold, Maximillion, one love keep it real yo. Yo, hit me for these Tommy Hill, ice-rocking niggas. this summer's mines, I blow the biggest. Back up off me, while I grab my dick and hold the Heini. Park the Blue 600. Wally kings is right behind me. Tackle clubs. never rock Lugz,. These mics is like the Golden Gloves verses spark plug. Cochran got OJ off. This specialist who. eyeballed your mistress necklace. Perpetuous, this curly-head kid's treacherous. Let go the eggo. Throw on can-can. Stark-ologist. Starks-ologist. fried fish halibut. let's celebrate like Kunta was born. We elbowed our way inside Loud and got on. burn a branch. Like Pilgrims G-in' Pepridge farms from out of millions. That rock that fisherman hat like Gorton's. I hold down the place, no shots to the face. Elite Special force no religious style faith. The melting pot boil. gun shot drama soil. Gamble when I scramble. handle hot pots of oil. Vampire curse disperse on each verse. Swim in black water. act slaughter through my earth. Mountain peak holds the globe like vagina. molecule and strand. Finger rolling rhythm. ride the horse one hand. Golden Eye, Spy vs. Spy, guilty of suspicion. Chess boxer, mic in dead body position. Divine universal black man representing. Battery in the back, keep me charged for the raw. I'm bred type thorough, pistolero gun hero. Renaissance rebel chatter-boxing your barrel.

But still ain\'t did nothing that ain\'t been done before. You can\'t be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot. And improvise and work with that little you got. So I think when I finish selling my last sack. I\'mma take some of this money, go and give some back. Cause people won\'t forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin?. And start thinking bout a path to pave. I\'m strictly stressin dirty dirty. Gone represent it to the t-top. Born and bred up on the street top. Get to the money and the sweet spot. And forever hollering "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops. I\'m strictly stressin dirty dirty. Gone represent it to the t-top. Born and bred up on the street top. Get to the money and the sweet spot.

S"Their feet kinda wild, to give off sparks. But I'll still light it up when the place is pitch dark. When I'm speaking it's the God projecting. Facts into brains of those unaware. Biters like biting, then yo you should chew this. Your man wants to beef, then we can do this. Then when it's time for you to face the God. I'll be giving you the whole nine yards. With lyrics that breaks the laws of gravity. So sweet to biters it gives them cavities. And can't be healed from the strongest toothpaste. So keep biting to see how the truth taste. You need guidance and self-assistance. Cause you lack the training to go the distance. But I'll rhyme, to the fullest length. And this is just a fraction of the strength. I'll never sweat an MC then say I wanna be him. Cause he makes a hit records and flips a coliseum. I learn to lead myself, not be a follower. I'm not a biter, stupid rhyme swallower. I created something funky fresh funky new. Brothers started playing monkey see and monkey do. Should I explain hip-hop, okay I love it. Simple definition but ya still don't know the half of it. And flip like I'm bugging off Bacardi and Pepsi. Dancers on stage like Alvin Ailey. While I'm deep into the roots like Alex Haley. You wanna try me, and be worn and torn. You react like an infant response to Similac. Or then again, could have been Enfamil. But for your information the rhyme is real. MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder. Tell you the truth it's just One Nation Under. A Groove, getting down for the funk of it. Fred Sanford in the business for the junk of it. When I'm premitted to break down a poem. I'm like knotty hair rippin out teeth from a comb. One by one so who you calling your troops on. Ya couldn't even bust a grape, with spike boots on. Biters are crooks and try to steal the stage. I read em like books, flip em and turn the page. I'm The Genius, you're living in deep fear. Go home and write and come try me next year. With stacks of rhymes or you'll be feelin ill troop. You being stuck in the ice cream and didn't know the scoop. [Verse 3]. Some say The Genius, has a style of his own. And his hands are like Vise-Grips holdin a microphone. Flowin smooth, with rhymes that are rough. In which the critics say is improper speech. But it's proper, only to those who understand. But I don't get upset, when you bite and steal. I go home and write some ill. Stacks of poetry, page after page. The way I come off on the mic is attractive. I can make a quadriplegic hyperactive. With lyrics of friction causing mics to spark. My style couldn't be bitten by a shark. MC's don't understand the way I be bombin em. Roll up and ask me what's the phenomenon. "

I couldn't do it so I picked it up and threw it. Off the building, just to see if all the children. Were quick enough to catch it. So I'll tear down these walls, let the chips fall. Let's all go outside and play a game of kick ball. Laugh a little, and live a lot. She squeals and giggles when I hit that spot. If you give me a minute and I can finish my beer. And move a tad bit closer to the limits of here. And when it gets clear, and the sun comes back. We can drive too fast, we can fly off the tracks. My rent just doubled, because they took my roommate. And I end every sentence with a dot-dot-dot. Mama had a baby and his head popped off. And when I'm running out of fire I just open the doors. And go sit on the porch and watch the neighborhood wars.

Encouraging poor lighting. Said ?a pall bore\'s not a sure sign of jarred lightning". Harsh, that\'s how the yellow spine-diner was born. Feral feeding that strung his organs up like tire swing art.

Unless you count the way they led his heart through his tuxedo tee. Straight out the front. 4 and 22. Cue the cut throat mouth. Chew together when a punk goes out. Etiquette of tart-tongued ghouls. Never run truck jewels. Run a culinary school for gluttony-drunk wolves. In guttural grunts. Smothering buttery lung ramen. Early sign of punk shows up on the diagnostic. Hm, pardon if I seem stand off-ish. All the see-sawed loss, I can\'t call it. All petite drawn straws and orange caution. Or outcast creeps re-involved for absolvement. It\'s gaudy. plus when a hell-bound offspring and yours share. evolves salty. Watch, if fortune is a bitch with venom and laser tits. Maybe sin ?ll make for sugar-flavored flesh.

They piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors. Buy the getty image, green-cheese moon. Dead-of-winter shit. graveyard tchk! tchk!. Shifter shit. brother was a face card.

Aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here. Supposedly closure\'l free the vipers out the bosom. Personally I think it\'s a bunch of bullshit. Prisoners,. tradition is for lovers. God forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some ?dip or play the dozens?. Now I baptize skips in larvae and dental records. On a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentence-enders. And the tech support for tragedy\'s emphatically horrendous. Teenage operators explaining what bated breath is. Pass, I wish it were something I could diagram on a napkin so you won\'t feel so detached if it should happen to you privately. Publicly your shadows\'ll cat call back. Happy to split the button eye and burlap doll. Crack the crypt. Bats eject. like cousin death\'s wing-ed lapdogs. ricocheting. sonar of the sacrilege. Now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards. I\'ll even grit my teeth for you. I am so completely off the god-damn grid it\'s not a question of addressing me. It\'s "what do these symbols under the dresser mean". Perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young. Could\'ve used a good lung. Still, proximity to corpses wasn\'t nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors. Fast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass coffin. "remember that cow in the dean\'s office seems awkward. And I know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain\'t it?. Maybe a dialog of howls that reshapes thejowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines. Either way - dope stone lion. And they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box. The crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box. Scientific, ritualistic, headstone cold foxes still rot. I\'m not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot. You can let them let you rot, man. But I\'m not going to watch. I\'m not gonna stand atop your plot. I love you friends, but I\'m just not. On the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea. I will swim in the sea and you\'ll be with me. And if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree. I will climb that tree. Everything you think you\'re hiding shows. In the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones. Messages you\'d tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks. You don\'t want the passengers to pass. You want each cow taxidermy\'d fatter than the last. Mausoleum lighting is a rush. While it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch. A proud chest puffed to the heavens. Holds nothing if we\'re cutting past the muscle and the tendon. And we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon.... '

Done by the dogcatcher, dogcatcher, it\'s the dogfetcher, I betcha. I\'m catching applause when I rock the microphone from the heart. As you can see, I drop funk bars from here to Mars. My style swarms over ghettoes like crack. But I bet you you can\'t do that, cause the multiplatinums. Can\'t save your ass on the block, and you\'re fucked if it ain\'t pop. Like peak Puma, I known to give a whole lots of lumps. I hang em like them niggas do in Texas. I give props to real MC\'s like. KRS-One. Kool G Rap,. Buckshot,. Busta. me and I\'m from. The East coast!!. bleacher. A menace like Dennis. I got game like Ennis. I can french-kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentence. And I don\'t have to be a Special Ed to get dumb!!. '

S"Give thanks, his rank is that of big stank dank. He often'd time drank by the river bank. An kept a silver shank, for a calm cat. Always stayed strapped for hand to arm combat. For DOOM the bell tolls. Let them fools know ain't no more room in these hell holes. It's filled up to the brim wit sold souls. Crackheads dope fiends an 40's of ol' gold. Whoever dare roll up, prepare to get folded. Like holly hobby, gosh golly gee. The back of hector hoskerish's trolly red wash me. Dag nabbit, the mask is like a chick magnet. Some'll let you stab it for a nic' of the babbit. They say he talk slick like Dick Cavett. A fiend for the mic an can't kick it like a sick habit. Give him a hero's holla. Along wit more free dough than creeflow dolla. They say he wear a mask in case his face show. It's better than a stocking bird brain. Find him on the corner rockin mockingbird lane. she's a bad mamma-jamma. either squeeze the damn hammer. Or stop complainin, on the top he's remainin. A lot of pop sensations need more proper home trainin. The people say he's the nicest. He only wants to be left alone to his own devices. If the price is right he might sing a new smash. Then laugh an twist his Rollie Fingers moustache. Tear ya crew a new.. gash. An prepare a new batch, of his own special herb goulash. Villain, the dork who talk funny. An he'll put one in ya, so watch where you walk money. Like Semy say, do more boomers, they cure tumors. "

S'I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me. And treating me silently. Yo, I had a queen named Amina, height 5\'7". Caramel-complected, body like heaven. Met her through the sister of my man, Big Vince. Like something from out the flicks we been in love ever since. She called me her chocolate brother, I call her my sugar sister. Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her. I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit. But because sex she wasn\'t with, she started flipping the script. Like, "Listen man, I\'m Queen Amina, Amina\'s not no freak and. That game is weak and keep trying to hit I could quit speaking. Tariq in fact, you bein Black Thought don\'t get you closer. I dig ya but won\'t bone ya because I\'m so-called supposed to. Most o\' them would, but that couldn\'t be me, that\'s not my flavor. Go home and think about that, maybe later on I\'ll page ya". I contemplated, and then concluded she was bluffing. Steady pursuing screwing, getting nothing but the silent treatment. Crazy frustration, about my loving situation. When patience was a virtue, but I wasn\'t used to waiting. I want some Marvin Gaye healing, feeling is real inside. Then sayin I\'m more sewer than Das EFX. Well umm. Moving right along with the song, plus the strong. Feelings on my mind,. I don\'t know what I got to do to make you understand. I\'m for real and that\'s no question, no fronting or no guessing. I\'ll never treat you like a dame or run game. I know you\'re not a ho for niggas with a lot of dough. '

But being speakers are the best. This here piece of the pie. Is not dessert but the course that we dine. And three out of every darn time. The effect is "Mmmm" when a daisy grows in your mind.

S'I won\'t take up too much of you time. I know you\'re trying to get your video game-grind on. And that\'s fine. Just gimme a second to empty my face. Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase. I\'ve been watching you and. I\'m proud of you man. You\'re growing up to be the best man that you possibly can. I know you understand. Why I go out of town. I also know my days are colder when you\'re not around. Sometimes I wonder what it\'s like to be adapted to the fact. That daddy never lived inside the same shack. And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach\'s pit. It\'s what I get. I\'m convinced it\'s my punishment. For those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar. In some city with some people I don\'t know. For all the times that the lines on your face. Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped. It trips me out how you pick up all my traits. From the way that you spit to the fists that you make. I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy. Daddy learned that from you. You\'re supposed to learn that from daddy. I can\'t teach much when it comes to women. I drive safe and slow but don\'t know nothing \'bout the engine. You\'re doing good little man that\'s all I really meant. I love you. You\'re my best friend, thanks for listening. [Verse 2]. Craig. What up bones? How it goes?. Yeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old. Sorry that the phone calls ain\'t too routine. Just been runnin\' around the globe tryin\' to do my thing. Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast. And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed. Other times I\'m not sittin\' on enough cash. And other times today feels too much like the past. Sometimes at night I would watch y\'all fight. A child wonderin\'. Why your life just ain\'t alright?. What\'s the violence about? Why\'s it in my house?. And even the memories are turned up too loud. Yeah, I got some issues in my head. Knew we should\'ve started fixing \'em back when she left you. I\'m not trying to get you down, I know you\'re different now. But your little man just wants you to listen now. I\'m over thirty, can\'t maintain relations. All these women want to hurt me and I just don\'t have the patience. I can\'t trust them, and they\'re not much help. When they start to push and pull the buttons I don\'t trust myself. What pride, fists, and words just might do?. I\'m afraid of my fate, don\'t wanna turn out like you. I\'ve never hit a woman. I won\'t do coke. And for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man. Sean. What\'s going on?. Not much to say. Just checkin\' in with you, trying to see what\'s wrong today. I know there\'s gotta be something kicking your bruises. How\'s the love? How\'s the music? How\'s the self-abusiveness?. Got a lot to lose, it\'s breaking your shoulders. So you let your paranoia place your bets for you. Too many cigarettes, messing up your voice. Too many arguments, trying to test your poise. The only women that love you are fans and family. Mom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly. No heavy rotation. In any location. You\'re not ready to face that you have no steady vocation. Plus you\'re getting old, your raps are exhausted. Stop it, everybody knows that you\'ve lost it. Singing for these kids you don\'t know. When you should be at home with your own instead you\'re on the telephone. Fighting with your girl like it\'s you against the world. Another drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus. Come and save him Jesus. Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas. Sometimes you\'re not impressed with the work you\'ve done. And love isn\'t love if you didn\'t hurt someone. Your son says, "Hi dad.". Your dad says, "Whats up?". And me, I wanna thank you, but I won\'t, I\'ll just say, "Good luck.". '

To break into dust and do as a line. Or roll it with space and lace it with time. Right after I separate you from your spine. I'm here to perpetuate your demise. I savor the hint of hope in your eyes. When I'm done I'm sticking my dick in a black hole and creating the sun. "

Out to clock corporate cogs and sprockets. Not clogs, all grommets. click. Serpentine, in and out of traffic jam and murder scenes. Scrub blood of the AF1s 52 Pick-up first degrees. Some toddlers smuggled tommy guns and crack into the nurseries. Dog, there's a fucking baby at the door asking for wallets. And those ain't twin Beanie Babies inside his pockets. 2010's sonograms showed the magnum formed directly out the fetus. Evolution for the young killer convenience. Magazine? Check, check. Paper route? Check, check. This is how the hermitted and busy bee connect. Now adays, even the babies got guns. Diaper snipers having clocktower fun.

Amongst tadpoles it happens. I used to think I'd get hit by a bus or something Dumb and Dumber. Now the bus is slugs plugged by the newest kiddie thug wonder. For tomorrow the holsters are bound to outnumber the roaches. I'm not a coach. But that'll even jolt the immobile. When global terrorism's all the rage, your folk get smoked local. Block, if you need me (Yeah?). I had to bounce to D.C. (Yeah?). To bullet-proof mom's flower garden before the war cheats me (Yeah?). If I'm not back in a week tell the crew I said peace and lay low. Strays don't vacate slow. Diaper snipers having clocktower fun. Jam Master Jay. So no, I'll probably never write another Daylight. Because the stingers tend to cling more than the portable hay-rides.

Collectin street props, splittin tops, didn\'t stop, so many men dropped. Started committin murder after murder. Blasted the last nigga that tried to riff so fast he flipped him like a burger. Slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger. He got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger. And this type of street violence today happens too often. It hit me hard as hell to see my dog up in the coffin. People droppin a rose when the casket is closed. Hey yo, that\'s the name of the game out on the street, that\'s how it goes. They say: "Live by the trigger, die by the trigger". It ain\'t about whose gun is more bigger, nigga. It\'s bout whose draw is quicker. So to my shorty dog puzzled I\'m pledgin. Died at the age of 17, Brooklyn East New York legend. Runnin around the neighborhood and up to no good. Started hangin hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars. Then put behind bars sellin drugs and pullin yards. Then got locked up from (Happy New Year!). All the way down to (Trick or Treat!). The two of those in a wardrobe of clothes. And then another sad story is headed for me. When I found out another soldier died in the territory. So in memory of my dog I write a lyric. Straight hopin melodies travel from my mind to your spirit. Hear it when I get biz for K-Von, I\'m pledgin. Died on 104 Northern Boulevard, Corona, Queens legend. '

This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision. You can see it through the lies and the phantasm. Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual. Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies. To eradicate the wise. But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies. Of the heavenly celestial sphere. Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears. A day to God is a thousand years.

Fuckin' with my people well that's called the Heath Ledge. Needless to say I turn rap beef to piglets. Make you speechless, make you bloody, make you teethless. Then the blood drip on the floor.

Spangled in hooks dangled by anglers off the plank of burning books. And if you're, not gonna eat that. Kill joy inherited by spirits lacking harnesses. Oh please, I know butterfly wings ain't fit to auction. I am the trying diaries of a low-life siphon through that feign. Anti-diligence movement. I witness the fusion of her breath and her amusement. And it killed me and it stabbed me and it cut me clear open. The notion that this child timid in her sins embraced pleasure. I'll take the hint but still she's never known cold. Call me in twenty when those bubbles explode it's like that. If you'd have only held the cup while I poured. Back to back to back to stacking a brick match. With the fact that I've sipped the dripping sap tap. Casually out the limbs of captivated blends back. Tracking the patterns that trim friends to thinning savages. Take one down, pass it round among us. Lick a tipper drink, drink, drunk, drunk, and drunkest. Oh my left hand is a brick layer my right hand is a plow face. theory's.

You\'re dreaming of arcadia, you\'re feeling like a baby tooth. Awaiting panacea. , channeling your inner Beowulf. In purgatory just before you pay up to filet yourself and others. In the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt. ego death. no telephone from Gabriel. I\'m half a human combing over home and garden stoned. Gold chains over turtleneck, cigars over cologne. A thousand shitty paintings wrap around the wounded animal. Woo him with the Schubert he\'s a future human cannonball. Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu. I\'m climbing up the stucco.

I finally crunch the budget up and punch the button. She called my name out and pushed me into an oven. I\'m shrunk. She says, "I\'m not your enemy". I said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say. Instead of playing off the chemistry" she said,  "You\'re being difficult". I said, "I\'m being guarded, you\'re a quarter mil in debt, I get more guidance from my barber. Look, I\'m not good at this, I grew up in a noogie-fest.

S"If there's no dish, then there's no rap. Records, albums, vinyl, the facts. The agreement turned cement. 40 years ago. Hip Hop, the vinyl frontier. Sent bop, sent rock, sent blues through it. From classical to jazz we can who?s who it. Or blow the dust off and groove to it. You know that crackle give the best high. Give me a needle, a cartridge, a partridge, some tree, 45s and a 33, let it be. A new format hit the scene like way back. It was smaller and more convenient than 8-track. You could pop it in your car on a long drive. Play the album or fast-forward to song five. If you passed the song you had to rewind it back. It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track. Memorex, Ampex down to TDK. Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK. When they was on the air, I was on the pause-button. I had the best taste but I ain't trying to cause nothing. Cause everybody thought their paws was the raws. Cats used to battle, this shit used to cause wars. Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three. purple tape. If my tape pop trust, I was ready man. A razor blade, scotch tape and a steady hand. I call it surgery. My cassette went under the knife and brought back to life. My relationship with bass and kicks had come full circle. Skip the skips with a flick of the wrist. The fickle dismissed this little digital disk. But try and play vinyl in the whip, it'll skip. flood the BOSE with flows and drums. sitting on chrome. little bone thugs. We got wheels, we ain't trying to walk man. CD's nuts, there's dust on my walkman. Holy matrimony but harder to see. Everywhere but non-existant. what a conundrum. Upgraded but they say we forgot where we come from. Off the record. the coming and going of Kbps. The message. Hate the virus and not the hacker, that's what a loser does. "

Until we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con. Feared in all streets so, if you ever see me out in y?all streets. Find another one to occupy. I never hope for the best, I wish a nigga would. Turn around and walk away, I wish a nigga could. Listen to my instincts and say fuck the rest. But once you?ve had the best better ain?t as good. Weak-heartedness cannot be involved. Stick to the script, nigga -- fuck your improv. Like the samurai. The street?s Hammurabi Code. Play your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told. I was always late for the bus. Just once can I be on time. Then I start to think what?s the rush. Who wants to be on time. Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time. In this crazy world. Not a thing I fear besides fear itself. This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else. Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf. Cross around my neck. I?ve been taught by stealth. Capture this moment in time?. it?s a smash and grab. And where my party people y?all finna have a blast. You say goodbye? I say hello first and last. Hello-Hello?. Now all of y?all elevate your glass. To an example of what time will do to you. When those nameless things just keep on eluding you. When shit is new to you and lies is true to you. Words of suspects-usual? coming though to you. Man, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time. Then I went missing looking for the sublime. A nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed. Time after time, verse blank, the line unrhymed. You ever wonder what?s the big fuss... For everyone be on time. What?s the big deal, why do they feel. The need to have us marching on line. Feeling unlucky and if I?d ever got lucky it was one time. In this crazy world. I wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes. If you born on the other side of the crack pipe. Niggas learn math just to understand the crack price. Then dive in head first like the jack knife. Cause out here, yo you niggas can?t belly flop. If you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop. One time means being on the front line. Being on the front line means ducking one time. The pendulum swinging my way- couldn?t be more blind. Niggas talk to the cops? Not even one time. Cause we all going down just like the subprime. Or a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine. But hopping over gates to escape is sublime. Then through the alley way and down to the sub line. Tales from the streets. A life of high crime. To make it to the bottom. Such a high climb. "

Come double fist them aqua-gats lock box your past and. Spoon up the ballooning for high noon saloony antics. Walk off with a thumbs up. And a stuffed Bullwinkle trinket. Holler back Wally Cleaver. Ramble,. Printmatic,. Blockhead. Ravipops. I rock the bells without clown shoes, fried dough, tickets or mallets. While the bearded ladies won goldfish from the ping-pong toss challenge. Threw like girls and misconstrued the lucky fuck floaters for talent. It's sad really.... O.k., I'm over it. Oozing that hollow 'who the mac?' act Aes threw back in junior rap. Isn't it strange how it's a fad to bite your idols. When the whole reason you liked 'em was cuz their shit wasn't recycled?. Purging little man behind curtain opinions. Look I'm just like y'all. Living low-pro to paycheck. And when the landlord hollers he hid the 'dro in the tape deck. Built an Einstein-Rosen bridge to '88 with Lincoln Logs and bobby pins. But you'll find validity in a penny, right. And I got a clear flick of the Loch Ness sucking off Yeti. He's hooky out the institution's huckleberry mold. Style leapt out a Hermann Rorschach margin mark. You're spilling insignificant frijoles. "

S'Jesus told many parables to grown-ups and children alike. He told them simply and sincerely, in words everyone could understand. So that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach. They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus. \'Till brake fluid sewage crippled up the get-retorted nickel punks. Slowly cope but swore his lowly robot vole evoke. Would one day rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost. Father, black suit white collar. Kiddie porn dungeon, guns, and three fingers for your daughter\'s. Caught belly-up, antique Nazi paraphernalia. You cannot pay your bills with holy water and Hail Mary luck [Oh my!]. Shucks fucker, enjoy the Alcatraz shower fun. And mommy\'s mad I\'m cliche generation X agnostic front. It ain\'t the nifty fate, the 1958, before the New-New Testament-approved. Altar-boy fisting rape. And "take me to your leader". Long as he don\'t manipulate toddler beaver. Call me crazy, but I bet that wasn\'t God\'s demeanor. Sodom-meter peaking [Me too!]. But Long Island was Jesus every weekend. Spoon-fed to appease traditional love bringing. Of a Middle Pennsylvania shit-hole. One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much MORE. made babies raised on what they SAW. Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy. But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies. Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags. And manger staff as long as Santa ate the cookies [Well...]. Grandma was a saint, while he\'d paint with snakes and bullies. Said If only you\'d memorized your prayers like you did your Kool Gs!. By the time I was old enough to know what religion was. I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn\'t give a [FUCK!]. \'94: Moved out the crib and it ain\'t seen a steeple since. What Knievel-evil seeps in a Christian leader\'s pitch. \'Till priests\' laps slapped with parental advisory warnings. I\'ll be auditioning Gods in my office on Monday morning. I need a couple A\'s for Q\'s. I\'m not an asshole I\'m just a little confused. [This story reminds us of the one Jesus told about people who were kind and. Helpful to others. He said that one day the king would say to these people:. \'Come. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you. For when I was hungry you gave me food. When I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.\'. But the people asked, when Lord did we see you hungry and feed you?. Or sick or in prison and come to you? and the king answered:. \'In as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren. You have done it unto me.\']. Just a little bruise in the back of the pews. Acting amused with a mask and them Vatican blues. For in the eyes of the organization I was raised in. Aes\' is just another cynic-brick in Hell\'s basement. Cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists. For what? Drugs and fucking, It\'s part of growing up. Like cuffs over dumb shits is better than the schools. I\'m not an asshole I\'m just a little confused. Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews. Watching a thousand flavors of the same God feud. I figure ultimate-peace is the common theme. So its a no-brainer "peace" when the blood hit the screen. Got a basic good and evil sensibility born. Good neighbor know a halo when it\'s fit over horns. I\'m more science than faith, I\'m more karma than bread and booze. '

Or the arrogance of someone who ain?t got shit. That think money over bitches is a stock tip?. [Hook: Modesty Lycan]. I live in a trap where things go crack. Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks. Everybody acts like God is all that. But I got the feelin? he ain?t never coming back. So I got an angel that answer my prayer. Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air. Nobody wins but nobody cares. They just want blood when the people cheer. [Verse 2: Black Thought]. I?m down to 95 dollars, that?s the extent of my riches. Out of 99 problems, 98 of ?em is bitches. Out here hollerin\' what?s ironic is. I?ve honestly been tryna do what?s right.

On my existential grind doing consequential dirt. Searchin? for physical pleasure if I don?t go mental first. Molly poppin?. trolley hoppin?. Know somebody prolly watchin?. That ain?t stoppin? me from coppin? a feel. Karate choppin? in this after-hours spot. Watching mommy body rockin?. First I feed her vodka shots. then she eat my Johnnie Cochran. Livin? fast, drinkin?. capt\'. One of them hoes even had. The audacity ask me how long this thing would last. I said, ?You wanna pay for class?. Get on that stage and shake your ass.?. She keep a dick in a box. And "in an emergency, break the glass". I make her laugh. She makes it clap. And then she gives me lap dances and I?m thankful that.

All I?m hearing is AIDS, I ain?t deaf in my ear. But he push them whites in the hood like Ray Edmond was there. Now me, Tony, G, and Tre got the keys to the nation. Of course he fiending for trouble, he had a fiend for a mother. Got no leaders among him,. Once the police get to cuffing, bet his homie deceive him. Politicians fucking hookers, why you mad at my ganja?. Kick him out of the city, force them whites who can pay up. Saeed Alisha I miss you, God bless my brother?s soul. And oh, I gotta find my way. Oh I gotta face the day. But oh I can?t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home. Ricky is sitting, Baba was sitting. Caught up and slipping for fearing a McDonald?s position. Seen it over a dollar, got him under a flower. Funeral drama, niggas mystery baby mamas. They ain?t really for condoms, I just think that it?s shocking. Got no fear in no officer, they be scared of them doctors. I?m aware that there?s problems, no Obama gon? stop it. Where there?s minimal conscience and there?s thousands of choppers. I know Howard that college, but uptown has some problems. I done seen embalming fluid ruin a nigga promise. Little women be mommas, little niggas ain?t fathers. Ain?t nobody here leading, it?s way too easy to follow. They knee deep in today, ain?t too fond of tomorrow. Although weight gets you paper, I pray you're weighing your options. We just soldiers, my nigga ? don?t know you, my nigga, but know you my nigga. This is soulful my nigga, hope that I am giving some hope to my nigga. We just soldiers, my nigga ? don?t know you, my nigga, but know you my nigga. A king's assassination is why most often fear the hell. So needless to say this, leadership is not with a timid sail. I pray whenever I?m seen in my city I forever resemble Braille. May your trees be loud. your queens be proud. May you see your dreams allowed, before you see them from a cloud. May your glass never reach half-empty,. may your enemies find the inner-peace before it ever get to beef. and the shit ain?t the best, hope these lyrics help...my nigga. "

S"The Dragon of Judah executed the Lion from Narnia. I'm still trying to build God's army up. The pedagogy tried to call me a communist. And pacify my audience, sprinkle them with zombie dust. The isosceldren is a prison for a three headed demon, Hip Hop behemoth. Knowledge is needed to argue with the followers of Jesus. Rearranging impossible pieces, my quantum is increasing. I am sleeping in a posturpedic, deeply breathing. Dreaming a chakra site-seeing, philosophically speaking. I saw Gandhi weakening from not eating. I saw police brutality beatings. I saw the leaders getting into spaceships and leaving. I tried to search for possible meanings. But I couldn't see the logical reasoning. Said survival of the species, no Macbook no PCs. Brown produce consumed by sick cattle. Bone thin mammals hooked up to intravenous vaccination panels. Collecting contaminated skin samples. This is not natural, God damn you!. Everybody on the planet don't deserve that, not even the animals. You are completely culpable for everything you're supposed to do. Even if it's not known to you. The weight of the language I spoke to you. The weight of the letters and the words in the rhymes that I wrote for you. Are so so emotional, I don't even know what to do. So I'mma leave the choice up to you. I spit like a supernatural computer. Hold me down Professor Griff. Now everyone want to talk about conspiracy. You should've took Channel Zero more seriously. Professor Bis got a ghetto Ph.D in Chemistry. Professor Griff taught me how to spit it lyrically. Now I'm part of the Ministry. Put my name on the blacklist. Cause I don't dickride nobody in the industry. Where's the fuckin' empathy? I've been through so much treachery. Most of the best emcees disrespected me and tried to get the best of me. Never tried to rescue me or help me with the recipe. What do they expect from me!?. Stressin' me, questionin' me to address the beef. I rep Hip Hop, Hip Hop don't rep me. I never got a penny off that Beef DVD. You mean all that money went to QD3?. If I was a different nigga, I'da been caught a criminal case. The best word to describe what you do to Hip Hop is 'rape'. You sit around your tables and say grace. Eatin' steak, while you live like kings and treat kings like apes. For Michael Jackson money, and still on the take. Even Tevin Campbell's money, the greed is so great. You probably dance around your mansion, like Cirque Du Soleil. Everything is paid for,. You makin' money off the next man's struggle. Why you can't pay him?. But didn't pay K-Solo or Eazy E. It's called Blaxploitation. Another one of Canibus' paranoid statements that's why I'm famous. I'm just tryin' to tell niggas how the game is. Beef in Hip Hop is just aimless entertainment. If I shoot you, I'm blameless, but if you shoot me, you famous. Wake the fuck up. "

A clever idea to take something They said. Into something we have, something we flipped. Into something with swag, nigga, don't be mad. Bitches ain't shit, but women ain't bitches. See, women are the queens, and bitches just bitches. And bitches say bitch like bitch is not offensive. When niggas say bitch, all of the sudden, they offended. And niggas say nigga to a nigga. A nigga write nigga in a lyric, expect the white boy to omit it. The white boy spit it like he spit it. Recite it to his friends who, by the way, ain't niggas. And say nigga, nigga, nigga, my favorite rapper did it. And non-nigga friends got it with him. Incorporate this lyric to their everyday living. Until a black friend kinda hear it, just a tidbit. He thinks Aw, forget it, its so insignificant and little. The white boy sees this as a clearance, now its. Nigga, nigga, nigga, every single day. And that little nigga nigga, thinks its okay. And he's the only nigga in this particular grade. And it begins to phase him more each day. The things they say went a little too far. He couldn't tell the difference between an a or er. So they just keep going, saying nigga in his face. There's nothing he can do, he let it get away. It came to the point he couldn't look 'em in the face. The mirror made him hurl, his reflection disgraceful. Yeah, and make sure everything you say. Can't be held against you in any kind of way. And any connotation is viewed many ways. Cuz under every nigga, there's a little bit of Kramer. Self-hatred...I hate you...and myself. Niggas. [Outro - Michael Richards]. Uh, I lost my temper onstage, I was at, uh, a comedy club trying to, um, do my act and I got heckled and I, I, I took it badly and went into a, a rage...and uh, uh...said some pretty, uh...nasty things to some Afro-Americans, a lot of trash talk...for this to happen, for me to be in a comedy club and flip out and say this crap, you know, I'm...I'm deeply, deeply sorry.

Hip-Hop ain't dead cuz the pulse is in us. I got the Everclear flow, they mimosa with it. We are the hope of the culture, they supposed to listen. And I'm supposed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league. I'm Oden with it. Yet don't owe them niggas nothing but potent lyrics. But if you ain't got the dance they revoke your spinning. So good rappers ain't eating they Olsen twining. With the counterfeit hitters they so-so with it, but they are Sosa with it. They Mark McGuire with the written. I'm Rodriguez.

S"This is a place where opportunities few. And niggas feud for land they'll never own. Where they raise hell and waste shells. And duck baby mamas but rarely escape jail. This is the trap... the trap. Death on my opposition, no. Them watchin' me blow is more than evening the score. And my team has a flow, ambition see the results. And to get to my spirit seeing twitpics of them diplomas, word. Cannot stress it, through God blessings we made it out. For the have-nots that have a knot to have knots. Hats off, we been working our ass off. And we all-stars that made the squad with the cap off. Steinbrenner. designed to make your dynasty weary. Sometimes I'm a dick, but you niggas placenta. And that's the problem, it's a problem, don't dap me my nigga. Just tap me my nigga, then get at me my nigga. Trust in God and you golden, trust in rap and you empty. Bust a mac and you gangster, that's how them youngins livin'. Shout out that Georgetown Press they still trappin' the district. Blessings we made it out, blessings we made it out. They still trappin' the district. Shout out that Georgetown Press they still trappin' the district. [Verse 2: Lightshow]. Lil nigga, but I'm Patrick Ewing on these blocks. My mac cold like Dikembe nigga, who need Glocks. These crooked cops keep tryin' steal the ball from me. But 'Le like Kevin Braswell with the rock. 600 plus assists. Hard work it comes with this? That's why I fuck with this. G set the fuckin' pick, I went straight to the hole. Went to college a day, dropped out went straight for my goals. Now it's dough in my mattress, my bitch look like an actress. Cuz I studied the defense, and I stayed after practice. On my way to the league, only limit the sky. Still I show up to practice, I can't end up A.I. Pay attention or miss it. Shout out to Georgetown but I won't get trapped in the District, nah. Leader of the people who ain't tryna be led. I seen bums happy as anyone. Millionaires set for bread. Some be livin' for crumbs. Motherfuckers don't fuck with us I still be showin' love. Cause if I was local and they was on it I'd be naah. Don't trip off what a bitch say, shovel on a good day. All my youngins put up numbers just like Bubbachuck in kente. When we can't hit the league we let the streets mislead and dictate. And there is no I in team, but can you read the eye on Vic's Page. Otto Porter with all the water servin' the corners. Rayful callin' up 'Zo Mourning before the tourney. Servin' drugs, some us don't make it out here. My niggas had some plugs, I gave 'em a better outlet. There's a difference in words: hustle and trappin'. See hustlers find a way out, while the latter can't climb up out it. The trap. Georgetown coach John Thompson made a personal appeal to Edmond to stay away from his players. He built this team into a national power, and now the specter of a D.C. drug dealer in the age of crack, you know, well, that could have destroyed everything. "

S'Me and my freestyle alliance practicin\' African voodoo science. Calculating May 5, 2000 the 9 planets\'ll be in alignment. Of a starship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet. And a big ass "Canibus Comin\' Soon" poster on the side of it. I\'m known geographically and intergalactically. That\'s why I got extraterrestrials that wanna battle me. If their craft didn\'t get trapped in the Earth\'s gravity. And that\'s really what caused Roswell. Undercover operatives workin\' for COM 12. Disguised as a nigga, signed with a record deal. Lyrically I\'m off-scale. So all hail or get tossed towards Hell, whatever y\'all feel. Briusin\' niggas, confusin\' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens. Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles. Hear the wild wolf growl. Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds. Wack niggas wanna be down but it\'s not allowed. Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you\'ll get punched in the mouth. With the southpaw southern fist. I\'ll bust your shit, swell your lip bigger than Bubba shrimp. You giant Goliath, niggas get shot with a rubber sling. My brainwaves on an encephalograph show that I\'m stark ravin\' mad. When I throw the florence flask in my hand. Flammable liquids in the lab explode. And you get stabbed with all the flyin\' glass. Trained to blow up commercial aircrafts. Just to see how long a nigga\'s breath\'ll last. I put him in a leather mask. Spray his ass with a can of pepper gas. Then watch him grab his neck and gag. Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh. "You wanna battle?" is the type of question you should never ask. Nigga, pick a tougher task, see who the fuck\'ll last. Whoever lose\'ll get a solderin\' iron up the ass. You need to recognize. My hand is quicker than the eye. Quicker than the five speed Jamiroquai drives. A lifespan longer than nine lives, infinite rhymes that can\'t die. A nigga with a divine mind. dedicate it to dimes. Dividin myself into hundred ten times. Flows that glow with auroras that sparkle like water. Fly like a saucer. with the torque of a Porsche. Murder a million MC\'s, then autograph all of their coffins. Been gettin it on since I been born and I\'mma live long. And I\'mma be gettin it on \'till I\'m gone. Look at all the stages I been on, all the songs that I spit on. A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndrome. In the wristbones from gripping microphones this long. I\'m just a small fish in a big pond. Nigga try to flip and get flipped on. My army march a million strong. Like the Nation of Islam with suede Timbs on. Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles. A lyrical lynch mob. Shittin\' on niggas drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on. Duckin\' down low like we in \'Nam fightin\' the Viet Cong. You better drop your flag and withdraw. My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors. And smash y\'all, attach y\'all to the back of my horse. And drag y\'all across the motherfuckin\' asphalt. You know who you are always talkin\' about your bitches and your cars. Your jewelry and your girls, it\'s like we from two different worlds. Cause I\'m beyond them, on some futuristic cyborg shit. I close my eyes when I freestyle, so I could read what prints across them. Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience. The raw shit. Call my reinforcements, the four horsemen. I\'ll even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin\'. Tell him it\'s important, tell him to call Sting three way and sing a chorus. Fuck the soft shit and fuck what y\'all think. My album\'s gold cause my album was the bomb shit. A hundred years ago they\'d have took you to see Sigmund Freud. You fraudulent, feminine, fragile as a feather is. With an effortless blow, I\'ll crack your whole skeleton. You think you\'re better than Canibus, where\'s the evidence?. You need to shut the fuck up, cause your breath stink. Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints. Battlin\' me, you never win. You thought you was the only nigga, that could sneak a weapon in. Cause after I\'m finished wreckin\' this shit. I\'m a drink a whole bottle of Henney and go fuck a lesbian. '

S'The perch of rare grimace on iron mask. I remember science class. If chemistry could silence the lions laugh I\'d be fine. (I fail to) Meddlein up. Adrenaline trades the leaves that walk the plank. Before the crimson struck a match this season. Meridian carpal will jolt your logic. When the burn earned its self normalcy for 20 plus. Run amok or sink; swim\'s not an option. She applied the lipstick slow. Slow enough for me to bask in. Fast enough for me to wish it lasted. Past my alarms cackling. The front line of its mystiques geeked off my proposals. Bargains for the ogres who prefer the roller coasters. (I prefer the roller coasters). Well that\'ll sip the blood of merry men. That\'ll grace holiday carols where the \'merry\' ends. Spiral past the auto craft, exhale into vinyl raft. And pirate your local rain puddle torturous. Try to shake pilot fish off your dorsal fins. Lets dive through the archives, Xanax on frantic planet. Stamp it with a notable brand to reap the profit. See I don\'t know hell but I\'ve read about it often. Sounds like a dope concept gone wrong. (Note to caution). Lets zoom into that war pig sensation. Lets disassemble the core\'s rotation. Sayin\', if you choose to build it you\'ll die by the tools you build with. So make some noise for all your predecessors reppin\' sturdy grill-age. Lets deny the nervous room to pace in. Lets review the hearts ramifications. Sayin\', if you choose to build or you\'ll die by the tools you build with. Take me to the basement. Lets remove the costume you escaped in. Hold up your legacies, I\'ll tell you which one\'s my favorite. Hold up your alacritive innocence. I\'ll teach you about the perks of patience in seminar format.. I\'ve worn that hat for seven years. That\'s why it\'s discolored, ragged and shitty. I ain\'t about to toss it when its been through all these dream wars with me. I\'m an undercover prophet, thrift shop garb. I\'d rather starve then sit inside this gridlock until it parts. This tailor-made routin? ain\'t suitin\' me. It\'s tight around my neck like 13 loops, rafter, an apple box. Heartless harvest of mine, I\'m tired of pissin\' benediction. Maybe it ain\'t healthy, but sometimes I\'d rather burn then let you help me. It\'s getting brisk, brick as fuck. My skin ain\'t thick enough. these icicles ain\'t civil. How many freezer burn victims can one society on tilt manufacture prior to higher being intervening just to release last laughter. And every tree trunk\'s made of third rails with tourniquet branches. And I learned to walk with an anchor in my back pocket. And man, I read palms during even the most brief handshakes. And man I ain\'t alive to pull the weeds around the spotlit. Well I\'m wallowin\', followin\' my little lost princess to the promised land. Hollerin\' my potent slogan, hell, if Nostradamus can. Conquering these open roads with throttle pin to floor. Cause I\'mma win right after I finish these chores. Take me to the basement. Take me to the basement.... "I think the greatest harm done the human race has been done by the poets.". "Well, poets are dull boys, most of them, but not a lot are especially fiendish.". "They keep filling people\'s heads with delusions about...love.". '

I used to love him but now I don't. I chose a road of passion and pain. Sacrificed too much and waited in vain. Gave up my power ceased being queen. Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend. Reached the crossroad which path would I choose. Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated. For something to happen that just wasn't fated. Thought what I wanted was something I needed. When momma said no I just should have heeded. Misled I bled till the poison was gone. And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn. Father you saved me and you showed me that life. Was much more than being some foolish man's wife. Showed me that love was respect and devotion. Greater than planets deeper than oceans. My soul was weary but now it's replenished. Content because that part of my life is finished. I see him sometimes and the look in his eye. Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold. But my heart is gold I took back my soul. And totally let my creator control. The life which was his to begin with. "

And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch. Negative's the attitude that runs the show. When the stage is the G-H-E-T-T-O. But Joe can't shoot a gun, he's always drunk. And Peter's pimping Jane, and John's a punk. Infested are the halls, also the brains. Daddy's broken down from ghetto pains. Mommy's flying high, the truth is shown. The kids are all alone. Cause it's just the ghetto thang. This title is sought by the coolest fool. Define coolest fool? Easy, the one who needs. Attention in the largest span and loves to lead. Just provoke violence due to one glance. Lies are pointed strong into your skull. Deep within your brain against the wall. Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat. Trugoy's. Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways. Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play. If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range. Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change. Do people really wish when they blow. Is it for the sunken truth which could arise. From out the characters in which the ghetto hides. Roses in the ring supply their shown relief. Standing in the rain is nothing felt. When problems hold more value, but never dealt. When ghetto life is chosen strong. "

S'You looked at me like "yeah, nigga, right". But you gave me your number anyway,. you were on the talcum. Powder,. how\'s about them oranges?. Moved away from home to school with big plans. By day, studied the history of music. By night, just to pay for that shit, you\'d dance. To get your pants was a Mission Impossible. We were both the same age, but I. Suppose wasn\'t on the same page, but in. The same book of life, so I\'d paged you when. I felt you that were getting off of work. Or either when you\'re on your way to school. We started hanging like Ernie and Bert. And in my idle head I\'m thinking: "cool". Just when I think I\'m going down your shirt. You\'re hiking up your skirt now. The events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be. Heaven or hell. The angelic nastiness. you possessed made you by far the best. Therefore hard to tell. You\'d dropped me off. the dungeon. Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering. Now are these niggas in this house up to something. Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?. Well, yes and no. Yes we were selling it. But no it wasn\'t blow. Cook it in the basement then move it at a show. Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled "ho!". Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand. And one in their ear. You know what I\'m saying. But, I kept your number in my old phone. Got a new chip flip with the roam roam. So it took me a minute to retrieve 7 digits. But I promised I would call you when I got home. But, when I got home I never did. By the time I did, heard that you had a kid. By some nigga in Decatur. Who replied see you later when he got the good news, that\'s life shit. Now, I\'m 19 with a Cadillac. My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack. Got a plaque but I\'m living with my pop pop. So I got Glock. and a low jack. You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw. And never said much cause half of what he saw. Was so far from that place you wanna be. That words only fucked it up more follow me. Are you starting to gather what I\'m getting at?. Now if I\'m losing you tell me then I\'ll double back. But keep in mind, at the time "keep it real" was the phrase. Silly once said now, but those were the days. When Spring Break, and Daytona, and Freakniks. Made you want to drop out of college and never go back. Move to the south, but that ain\'t a Kodak. Moment,. on went myself and Big Boi. Well you knew him as Twan. That\'s right, you were around before this shit begun. When Twan had a daughter and. Sort of was made to mature before the first tour. We hit the road like jack. Yak. Girls used to say, y\'all talk funny, y\'all from the islands?. No, I\'m from Atlanta baby. He from Savannah. maybe. We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey we. Got to go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes. She\'s playing tennis disturbing the tenants. 15-love. Description is like 15 doves. In a Jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost. Making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?. Enough about me, how\'s about you?. How\'s the lil\' kid?. I hadn\'t smoked or took a shot of drink. Cause I\'d start the 2nd album off on another note. Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off. But see I\'d balled out, and before I fall out. I\'d Slow my Lac down to a nice speed. The brain is that fried egg I might need. New direction was apparent. I was a child looking at the floor staring. So changing my style was like release for the primitive beast. Yes I was on the rise, yeast was the street. To make bread. macaroni niggas, imposters. So on a trip to New York on some beeswax. And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head. Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with. Which I was rocking at the time. When I was going through them phases trying to find. Anything that seemed real in the world. Still searching, but I started liking this girl. Now you know her as Erykah "On and On" Badu. Call Tyrone on the phone why you. Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed. The song wasn\'t about me and that ain\'t my name. We\'re young, in love, in short we had fun. No regrets no abortion, had a son. By the name of "7" and he\'s 5. By the time I do this mix, he\'ll probably be 6. You do the arithmetic. We do the language arts. Y\'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts. To poke you in the heart. And take you from the start. To when luxury transportation meant a Marta card. Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays. Momma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she\'s smart. Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor. that Rabbit. You fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it. You give it all your time because that\'s all you can think about. And that\'s as far as I got. (music fades). [Radio Interview]. And that\'s as far as I got, and where I wanted to go. Knowing the whole time that\'s all you could think about. Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up. You need a jump like you\'ll need and you\'ll want to grow. And you change all the time so that Rabbit that you thought about. That whole summer, the next summer you didn\'t want that Rabbit no more. You wanted something bigger and better. . (Interviewer). So the summer past and now the Rabbit\'s old?. . (Andre).

Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo. Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan. Never turn my back on my kids for them. Should have hit it, quit it, rag top. Before you re-up, get a laptop. Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals. Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals. Record number four, but we on a roll. Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control". Like Janet. plan it, Stankonia\'s on ya. Moving like Floyd, coming straight to Florida. Lock all your windows then block the corridors. Pulling off a belt cause a whipping\'s in order. Like a three-piece just \'fore I cut your daughter. Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border. Pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5. I\'m a microphone fiend tryin\' to stay alive. When you come to ATL boy you betta not hide. Cause the Dungeon Family gon\' ride, hah!. [Hook]. [Dre]. Don\'t pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang. [Choir]. Bombs over Baghdad!. [Dre].

S'I won the title a couple of times. Let me show how to handle yourself man. get up in there move that head man. Come on to me man,. when you come, man. You gotta come for blood man. Yo Canibus your main objective out here is to do nothing but. Eat, eat, eat, eat, MC\'s for lunch, breakfast. So I\'ma let the world know the truth, you don\'t want me to shine. You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine. That\'s a bitch move, something that a homo rapper would do. So when you say that you platinum, you only dropping clues. I studied your background, read the book that you wrote. Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke. Fronting like a drug-free role model, you disgust me. I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently. You walk around showing off your body ?cause it sells. Plus to avoid the fact that you ain\'t got skills. Mad at me ?cause I kick that shit real niggas feel. While 99% of your fans wear high heels. Ice-T. Kool Moe Dee. Jay-Z. You dripping with wack juice, and you can\'t get it off. We\'re warriors man, when we go into battle. We come out or don\'t come out at all. Blast you with a .45 colt, make you somersault. Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts. Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk. It\'s about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first. That\'s why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse. That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life. ?Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th. God bless his soul rest in peace, kid. It\'s because of him now at least I know what beef is. It\'s not what I would call this, see this is something different. A faggot nigga tryna make a livin\' off of dissin\'. Well let me tell you something: you might got more cash then me. But you ain\'t got the skills to eat a nigga\'s ass like me. And if you really want to show off, we can get it on. Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom. I\'ll let you kick a verse... fuck it, I\'ll let you kick \'em all. I\'ll even wait for the studio audience to applaud. Now watch me rip the tat from your arm. Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award. In front of your mom, your 1st, 2nd and 3rd-born. Make your wife get on the horn,. call Minister Farrakhan. So he could persuade me to squash it,. I say "Naw, he started it. He forgot what a hardcore artist is". A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself. Trained to run 20 miles in soft sand. On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand. Fuck that! ?Cause like Common and Cube, I see the bitch in you. And I\'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker. second round knock out,. 3 minutes and 40 seconds,. lunch, breakfast, dinner. '

From off the pavement. I hate gettin locked up. Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships. But then the bible never saved shit.

I use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste. Disgrace your date put your title to waste. Dominant lyrical grace, from a place called wild. Illadelph Isle Pensy, that's the residency. Consistent currency, my pockets never empty. Some cats, believe they MC but we know they all fraud. Do a show in Philly niggas wouldn't applaud. Nobody know your record nor who you openin for. Can tell your squad's artificial while approachin the door. So you should prepare, for lyrical terror that's pure. Step up to the resevoir, of the soul proprietor style. Messiah or, the higher law down with Dice Raw. The matador, shorty connoisseur. Stompin whatever you build to the floor. Similar to that of a dinosaur. I told you I'm the rap predator. You insist to imitate, what for?. Superstar niggas is ten percent real, ninety percent invented. For a fuckin record deal. Comin with somethin veterans can't feel. I hit you like a steel anvil. Because you grafted off the next man's skill. theatrics of Othello. P.L.O. conniseur of fine cannabis. Focus never weak, blow up the spot like plastique. Leave a nigga shook, to the point, he won't speak. Mad lights I had to black out, when fake niggas act out. Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face. All y'all niggas is fake, tryin to emulate my style. What grown man? In this game, to me you're a child. Why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams. Of horrifying things, that your ass never seen before?. You traveled to the realm of Dice Raw. Where clones get they dome blown with chrome microphones. Logan Vall sol-dier. Knuckle games and hammer cocked ain't nothing sweet or soft. Win, lose, or draw. No conversation is needed, my task completed. Read a nigga up and down in the cut where I'm seated. Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis you ignoramuses. You laid on your lap, when I attack your glamorous. Lifestyle, I banged your head up with the white fowl. My character a product of this two-one-fifth trife style. that galactic style as of a Vulcan. "

I move on ones who double-cross. Set them up, now they suffer the loss. Informants, rattle-tattle-telling snakes. Get shot up, brutalized and thrown in lakes. The parts of a body is found days later. The other half was done by an amputator. I'm undefeated in plenty fights. My enemies are beaten with many stripes. I'll shoot up funerals, firebomb wakes. I'll set ya own mother on fire. Cause when it comes down just to me and my money. Ain't a fucking thing funny. All those who pose a threat I'll stick them. Ya friends, ya family and innocent victims. I'm busting of nines. But they was in the wrong place, the wrong time. Decapitated bodies found in lots. While I'm still cooking up kilos in pots. The kilos becomes bricks and the bricks becomes rocks. I drive around in expensive cars. And get women who fuck like porno stars. I get them high, you know, like powder they nose. Then put 'em in the streets as my high-class hoes. I'm wild, living foul and I'm ruthless. I leave muthafuckers toothless. I had a worker who stepped on the scene lively. Then started selling my customers Ivory. Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks. I stuck 'em to death with a thousand thumbtacks. You've seen my resume, that's just the half. I'm a bad muthafucker, just like Shaft. A character played by who? Richard Roundtree. The only difference, my guns are sound-free. Silencers ring off then wisp by. Then all you hear is a last minute cry. Of those who triedto control my territory.

Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch. I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette. Now you standing there wit razors in your head like barrettes. Man, if the mic had ass cheeks. The sticker in my hand would say priority seating. But your girl was on my dick like she was teethin\'. You play the role, I\'ll play the poppy seed on top of you. One of the first MC\'s to give the crowd full attention. Cuz you need love and affection. If we could absorb every star in the sky. We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why. It\'s the simple things in life that turn the peasants into leaders. And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers. I boogie with picketer vision, carbon based stickler. City piss aroma, therapy coma. clone sitter. Itching to pigeonhole villain soul magnet. Feelers activate. Passion ate the germ, and the book met the worm. I hold a book of matches captive to flash if. The sunbeams flatline. Via thick fatigue episodes, brewed in batches. The flirt of cursed perks nursed broken skeleton patches. One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center. Housing style pageants. My little limbs lasso katydid wings. While mankind\'s babysteps break dirt and demon. I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of. Mass times weight times tamed semantics. Encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage. To hell with plastic, we edit splendid. Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, apprehend it. Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again. It still never renders suspended \'bove finicky picket fences. Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts. Start with cadaver parts and a blueprint. He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear. Let the tears braid. And skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade. Gold-plated tomb or spittoon. I couldn\'t see. I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree. The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance. Was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance. '

Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap. Karl Kani jeans. fat stomachs in the limosines. I'm on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway. Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion. Since I been out, y'all can't see. Is the world made of plastic?. Is the city buried in dreams? (Yeah). Is the world made of plastic?. Cause that's the way is seems (Owww). Graffiti playgrounds are played out, yo how'd that sound?. I saw the place turn plastic. Clearly all samples, your SP-12 fake examples. E-40. My sound proceeds with Moog and undertone bass. As I do see soda, wack, rugged beer commercials. Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles. Manhattan I heat up, yo light up Times Square. No promotional shows, girls wear corn rows. People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes. I walk with straw hats and glasses in the projects. You bought sneakers, no car, scrambling on the corner. I'm not the star you are, the city's fallen far. My mechanism, you're on my tip. Stay off my penis, you've duplicated me for years. "

Listening to the dead air on the radio. Trying to decide which exit to take on the I-94, feeling kinda lost having misplaced the directions. Say still three circles careful not to lair. And I don\'t know if you know who this is but I can smell the liquor on your breath. i was just wondering if you might like to sit and talk about the carpet and the ceiling for a while.. Wise men couldn\'t see it in their dreams. No longer is it a get over situation. What are you really saying? (Do you think she\'s listening?). What are you really saying? (Do you think she\'s really listening?). What are you really saying? (Do you think she\'s really listening?). Do you think she\'s listening?. If it makes you feel better, go head. Make me feel small.

She\'s a high plains drifter. loner. Cool disposition getcha, shows you new level. Crazy, abrasive, enough to make me wanna taste. To figure out what makes it tick so I can dig it out and break it. Curiosity killed the cat. but liquor helped me build back all of the confidence dripped. Intrigued by the fact that she could fuck, shower and bounce out my house. like that. Left me sleeping with my doubts. Okay, wait I know her steez, self-inspired detachment. Keeps her cold like a breeze, she needs a heated passion. Good bedroom stabbin\' break your back kinda fun. Wild, buck, turn the beats up, I\'m loud when I cum. Instant-ly my jacket is on and I\'m errect. Get with me, "Baby where\'d you park, let\'s jet". Yo, she\'s the kind of girl that doesn\'t want no relationship. But damn I think she\'s kinda cool but damn just be patient kid. Regular basis for sex for quite a while. Puppy chased his tail carded yo he wants the idol now. Never shoulda brought it like that. Cause now when I think about it and look back. I\'ll never forget the way she laughed when I asked. If the only way I\'ll ever get to see her is when she\'s on her back. B-b-but the first time we fucked was shaken. Wild, Digital Underground style, no lies, no exaggeration. "Glad to make your acquaintance, what\'s your name again?". "Molly". "Good golly Miss, here take my digits please call me". She was cool like that "Yo how\'d you get like that?. I\'ve never had a date that gave me head like that". And it was said like that and she replied with a "thank you". "Before you leave Molly, let me kiss that tattoo on your ankle". So like a good bitch I make the example "Baby, how you been?". Half an hour later we\'re in a park, fucking like old friends. Turn on a dome light to get my pants on right. "Travel safe, see your ass around, have a good night" (bye). That\'s it, no conversation, game playin\' over some coffee. She\'s out, moments after she pulled that body off me. I\'m stressed, I\'m stressed, I\'m so confused. She doesn\'t seem like the type that\'s that loose. So maybe she does, realistically I don\'t know her that well. But if you let me, I\'d follow that sexy ass to Hell and back. Tell her that (tell her that). \'Til you call out my name and return you get silence. '

Instead of sitting sideways like some lunatics. We done took a beating that done put us on our knees. And don't even hear the click click when I turn the keys. Neglected all the checklists, proper maintenance. Spark plugs, wires, the bleedin' brakes and shit. We was too busy screamin'. Radiator hot, then motherfucka steamin'. Transmission locked up, lack communication. And radio done take the music out of conversation. Got me sittin' looking silly on the side of the road. I rather keep it moving hitch a ride in the cold. Her ambition faulty as my transmission. When pulled off the fluid her ass'll keep shiftin'. One touch, is a clutch, I had to keep stickin'. And my feelings died out, the spark is just missin'. This bitch won't put it in park and just listen. I keep reminiscing 'bout how she first started. Before it all turned to scrap, I'm broken hearted now. When the rubbers gone I slide to new targets. What fueled our desire put a hole in the sky. She was bound to the ground and I wanted to fly. Drove me crazy how she fronted like she wanted to die. Needing a jump, in her life so she'd break down and cry. But I still look for girls with pipes just like her. Junk in the trunk, and headlights just like her. Now, when I walk to the bus stop in the rain. I pause and catch myself thinking of her game. With every single penny that I put into this transmission. It's a wonder that you're screechin' and you can't listen. The ambition of this salesperson pricin' me her quote was high. Still with primer for a coat, I'd buy ya. Like let's make a deal, shake hands. Her piston is hissin' with 80's drama and the whole nine. On top of that, my baby's mama had to cosign. If a piss stain can locate a fire. I can reshape the bent frame and rotate the tires. While hand signals switch lanes. Though it's not a terrible perk. The radio is only AM and barely works. Still, for a few weeks. You could see me leaned back, smilin', excited on the blue streets. But now you're on E, something in your inside's blown. And I'mma have to hitch hike home. "

It's in the cells now, you thought that was yesterday?. But the compression stays, trauma still got most afraid. Stuck in the memory, fear gives birth to lethargy. Generations of children in jeopardy. History written in jealousy. scribes full of heresy. ch-ch-check out my melody. Musical therapy, reprogram. Africa full of coal tan. Coltrane was a cold man. Black genius in a cold land tryna be the whole man. Heal the homeland. Past time for our own land. Where a grown man can be a grown man. The system has benefit for robbery is robbery. Divine creator stuck in monotony. Bureaucracy, psyche on poverty. Self-esteem broken like pottery. Sovereignty. Walking university. Without apology. I've got life. I've got laughs. I've got headaches. And toothaches and bad times too like you, you, you. The more you suppress life the stronger it gets. With death life the longer it gets. That you follow some bullshit. Swallow the wrong pill looking for mr bill. Fear the shadow that?s the main thing (main thing). Fields of cumbersome back breaking labor.

Sinner man  looking for a place to run. Tell the truth in tongues? enemy reduced by one's. Thousands 2 can put 10,000 in flight. Speak truth to power every 24 hours. Imperialism is a form of Jihad. gold bullion. in the name of God. The children of mammon called it spiritual famine. Can we examine. they. bauxite. rubber. labor. diamonds. platinum?. build the colonies. Using reverse psychology to keep us from knowing our quality. Let?s accurately diagnose our condition!. Listen:. 400 years of the abuse and misuse of religion. Don?t give me another person?s prescription!. Mezanmi!. Reevaluate history, expeditiously. mulate the apostrophe hang with S, you can rock with me. I come in love and truth (truth). Life. [Hook]. There?s a whole lotta wrong to be righted.. I get excited. I'ma kick this shit off like I?m on Manchester United. my attention is undivided, so you can?t divide and conquer me!. my meditation. I?m taking the bomb back. I?m splitting atoms for freedom. America needs more FREED men, able to talk right, not prone to GREED men. accountable to a higher government.

S'You wanna battle? Swing. I bring commanding men like I was king. In all your dreams I write the horror flick of Stephen King. I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera. If you live by the sword you will be die by the gun. I was ordered to Code Red, but now I\'m chillin\' with A Few Good Men. Assassination on the kid from the capitol. I never play the soap opera but now I\'m in General Hospital. So if I die, catch me at the funeral. I\'ll fly away, ohh glory. With a mic in my hand to a land where only God knows me. And the angels write raps on holy paper. I said I\'m lookin for Jesus, he said "Take the escalator. One flight up, is guaranteed He\'ll be there". My sister\'d be there, my mother\'d be there. I don\'t puff blunts so I always got my breath. Never had to battle with a bullet proof vest. They call me cock-weasel but I, still cave a chest. I don\'t wear Jheri curls cause I\'m not from the West. No disrespect to the West, true indeed. I rock it to the East, the East is the seed. To see that them days back, yo sheepskins and Hot Tracks. Peace to Mr. Magic, things are getting tragic. Now we on some new stuff, I never feared the Ku Klux. My own clan is actin up, I blame it on the Phillie blunt. What you gonna do, kids are acting oooohhhh. Hill is gettin\' badder, yo where\'s the corporate ladder?. Mr. Three Piece Suit. Check the square roots, Girbauds and Timberland boots. Nahhhh that\'s the serpents, and know them garment tips. I feel a Jones comin\' down, yo I.... [Wyclef:]. (I got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang. A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy head bang). [Lauryn:]. No I, got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang. A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy heads reign!. Hey yo a battle is a battle but a battle\'s not a battle. If it\'sssssssssss snake doesn\'t rattle. As slick as a Nu Nile, as new as a new child. So come follow me to the land of Abraham. This land\'s your land, this land\'s my land. The blacker the black man, the better the next man. nappy heads need to check they necks for red. "Oh you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?". Word is bond, you get wrong. I\'ll have you sing like Louis Armstrong. And I say to myself, what a wonderful world. But what the hell was so wonderful \'bout cotton in the farm. Mr. Slaaaaaave Maaaaan!. The harder they come, the harder they fall,. Don\'t stall or I\'mma stick you like a voodoo doll. Out of Hootaville, land of the ill kill. Vailsburgh Viking so you know I\'m top ranking Phil. Cause I\'ve been rockin ever since eighty-two. When I used to rock my Pumas.... Yes, yes y\'all, well I\'m a Libra y\'all (4X). I wear my sunglasses at night. To spy on my girlfriend that\'s right. '

Shut up shit-talkers and made wanna-be thugs huddle. The world ain't all money, suckas and violence. Shit's hard, especially hits to scar the soul. That's why niggas drink and stress for cigars to roll. Cause we really fragile but thinkin' we tough. I try to help out my fellow man, sometimes get yellow hands.

On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss. Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must. I remember when the Deuce was all porno flicks. Running home after school to play PIXX. At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street. And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet. Dear New York, I hope you're doing well. I know a lot's happen and you've been through hell. So, we give thanks for providing a home. Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves. The L.I.E., the BQE. Hippies at the band shell with the LSD. Get my BVD's. from VIM. Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's got thrown out. You didn't rob me in the park at Diana Ross. But everybody started looting when the light went off. on out to Queensbridge. From Hollis Queens. right down to Bay Ridge. From Castle Hill. to the Lower East Side. From 1010 WINS to Live At Five. Cause in the city were ourselves and electric, too. I see you're still strong after all that's gone on. Life long we dedicate this song. Just a little something to show some respect. To the city that blends and mends and tests. Since 911, we're still livin'. And lovin?, life we've been given. Dear New York, I know a lot has changed. 2 towers down, but you're still in the game. Home to the many, rejecting no one. Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from. "

Conscience, not a complimentary voice. It breaks me down and tells me lies so vicious. I'm not like I used to be. In hind sight, the misery manipulated my life. Twilight twinkling, representing my stripes, along the journey. Earned in a fight like, battle to regain what was lost. In the Mai-Tai cocktail of my 20's. In bright bright lights shown across the screen freely. Just so some souls could avoid the same deities. Devils and demons, Angels and healings, rebels and. Reasons, exposing the changing of seasons. A mangy hound, to the best in show. The skull can be a prison, if just one kid listens. Then 100 years is worth every sentence, I'm on life row. Sentenced to a century. Starting through the bars glaring hard at the sentry. Guarding every scar with a heart feeling empty. Poppi was a star burning gars full of sensi. Mentally. Reminiscing how he used to stash that. In a white hatchback. Now that money's rare like a pro white halfback. Didn't kill a soul but the system sent him Amtrak. Chance of appeal looking lean like lamb fat. Prison yard sun rays Sunday to Sunday. What he miss is moonlight. Product of a goons life. Howling at the nothing in the sky away from eye sight. Raisin in the sun nothing left ahead but hindsight. Quiet the mind. Silence the tongue. 61 more trips around the sun 'fore we done. Make it last forever they sang. Then the rain came down turned pleasure to pain. And some couldn't stay sane. They'd run from pillar to post. Even chose to kill they own brains. Or make others feel the strain. Brothers from the same mother ranged. Bipolar to hi roller. Pharmaceuticals for my beautifuls in a stroller. That ain't worth the money. Get the power from the solar. Hit em with the honey. And the natural soul. Show em love, blow em kisses, grow em grub. Need no lifejacket, I can float the tub. In August 63 Earl stood with King, Junior. Pain in his past he dreamed for the future. In 92 he stood with King, Rodney. Trying to leave a better world for his progeny. Living room TV in 63. Saw JFK slumped over in his seat. Hospital bed TV in 08. Watched 44 carry 28 states. The same states that viewed Earl as a heathen. He turned around and shot guns for they freedom. World War II lucky to come back. In 91 he lost a son in Iraq. Enough to make the old man's blood boil. Earl bled for freedom, his son bled for oil. In his belongings cassettes by P.E. When Earl was young they lynched kids in the streets. But now the Klan wears Blue not sheets cus.... [Hook]. "

By the mechanical stagger. Theologies who seem to keep the jukies caffeinated. Like a Mad Hatter had to sleep now. Ask after. Stripped ego. Tall stories of brawl glory. I\'ll be God while you\'re still living life on a full 40. Or maybe I\'ll be grimacing, homes. Poor, broke and lonely. Hidden by my billygoat beard and cardboard monstrosity.

Plus my "straight and narrows" got more curves than a Russ Meyer vixen. Checkmate. Little Jackie paper and a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery. Some get excited when the Sun folds under.

Where global monetary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice. The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens. Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins. Un-shielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted. Left to bake in the searing naked rays of light. Wholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government. Leaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves. Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreck havok. Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out. Unleash total world wide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust. Annihilating the terrified masses. Leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers. Begged on revenge, but against whom?. . There are so few left alive. Starvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path. Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow egg shell. Causing unending volcanic eruptions. The creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison. Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure. Laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers. Fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains. This is, Extinction Level Event. The Final World Front, and there is only, one, year, left. Little girl: wow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!. . Dad: You don't have to, because here it is... (echoes out). [Busta Rhymes].

Sand and sea as if the jazz was free. I?m Ice cream mixed with gasoline. Direct attention to the craftsmanship. Neglect to mention that the past will stick. Like initials carved in the concrete. Like the tattoo that hides on your mommy. I still kick it with angels. The difference is instead of the bar, I?m at my kitchen table. The starlight shines through the glass. But you feel safe underneath that mask. Verse 2. Ferris Wheel, give rides. The scars healed in time to get high. Lock the doors and hide the keys. Let's go describe how to climb a tree. Don?t sign the lease just cop a corner. For you to curl up and try to sleep. Those cheap police won't find my wings. I keep my dreams inside my dreams. And If I had a time machine. I?d probably use it like a vacuum and try to clean. It kind a seems, quite more than a handful of these regrets have been circumstantial. Now give me all the cash out the drawer. Touch that mustache down on the floor. And I?ll be in court holding a pitchfork. 'Fore I let the contest outlast the sport. Pocket watch, impatient. Find a mate then make the migration. Break the rules, but first break the rulers. And keep it moving like a rumor. I don?t need to defend my defensiveness. I keep to myself, my family, and friendships. I?ve got enough people I could disappoint. If you disagree I think you missed the point. Now go ahead and grab a chair. Let me tell you about the last few years. Pulled out a sack full of Samson?s hair. And put it on the dash like a dancin? bear. I wrote you a horoscope. It won't fit on this post-it note. But if I had to sum it up into a shorter quote.

My Angels jetted out of Albee Square. kinda crowded so they clap in the air. Chased a nigga down block for block, squeezing Glocks. The more they ran the more their skirts got dirtier. Sending shots like check day, Fed Ex expressway. "Who shot that duck out the window", Mr. Lee said. Then I pulled up, "Come on girls to Club Med". Two brown sisters assisted the Villain, DOOM. He woke up stoked like they was still in the room. Freed his right arm and leg, it was more like a sweep. Release his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet. Staggering except for the socks and mask, naked. Threw on the boxers, searching for the Treo. Checkin\' for the keys, the dough. A robbery expected, yet nothing obvious is missing. Recollected now why Hollywood hotties stepped in Giuseppe Zanotti\'s. Chasing Patrice with Thai iced teas. The part of Mr. Roper. was played by Mr. T. '

A city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town. I saw vandals catching tags. Puerto Rican flags. I saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting.

A Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his dames. A thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses. I saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair. A pothole. a storefront with a broken open sign. A hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time. I see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver. squatter. angry right-to-lifer. I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street. And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds. A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it. I see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes. I see a teen mother with Similac, pacifier, and regrets. hammer with a rusty nail. A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance. I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette. Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents. I see a crack in the sidewalk. A slide show of sick civilians gripping bottles like idiots. Sitting inside bent meridians. sun spout. Spraying yellow beams. And children in the hydrants. Hybrids, I see sirens. The wall to the glamor standard. A bus stop where commuters wait to have their souls towed off to work. To huff that good leaf on the way to damage packages for peddlers. bandwagons, all aboard. A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury. I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors.

Kept the balance, stay dressed for the weather now. Battle M.C.\'s, anywhere, whatever town. And remain victorious, in any ground. The All In Together Now, started in Bed-Stuy. Human beatbox specialist, who dressed fly. A half ounce of blow and a forty ounce drinker. Unique. And had bitches eating out of his hand. I can name ten niggas that stole an element. He caused earthquakes, just from experiments. Giving birth to new styles. The judge took a look at he, and threw the book at thee. The sentencing,. Gave him no phone calls, saw no sunlight. Then days became weeks, weeks became months. Carved the calendar on the wall, with his fronts. The food pushed in, on the trays, looking sharp, in the cell. By hands covered with latex gloves. Cooks in the kitchen had laced his drinks. The wild ass physician, they was off the breaks. He got visits from shrinks who came in with ink-blots. "Now white doesn\'t really wanna use up his few remaining pawn moves, so he plays king to e2". '

Fuck chasers, trails, fuck raves and rails. Fuck hangovers. fuck hallucinations. Regurgitations. mandatory sentences and UA tracing. Blind my insight and dull the common sense. Give me inhibition, kill the superstition and the confidence. Built a tolerance, now it's more that I consume it. When it boards up my room. the world's whores will croon in unison. Unify the eulogy, autopsy pages read euthanasia,. i.e. irony. But here I be within a pool of my drool. Sedated, windows dilated, comatose, life overdose. Tell Jacob Miles. to keep it wild style.

Carry the most beautiful bitches. With us, happily toast. Keep the faculty close. Gross when we give them a dose. Got them ODing, leaning in each coast. Scenery froze, take notes, Rock Rolls. Diamonds that fit in Chanel Minks in the winter. Who fucking with us. We coming to give them the shivers. Watery flows, spilling like rivers. Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas. King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up. Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up. [Verse 2: Q-Tip]. Please don't throw up. Hold your liquor, grow up. If you robbing niggas. We going to show you how to blow up. Thank your lucky stars. It's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in. My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin. She gives in every time that I spin. Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall. We wade on, talk shit while we ball. So what's cracking with y'all. Native New Yorker. And the slick talker keeps it in order. Call the reporter. Stepping like the British walkers. Legendary swag flu and see the influence, see how we do it. until they pop off. Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off. Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers. Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa. Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over. See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter. And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it. And count the money up proper, cause you can GET IT. [Interlude: Kanye West]. Yeah. It feel good, don't it, uh. It feel good, don't it, uh. Ay, I want to let y'all know, ay ay. I want to let y'all know, this Yeezy. And you listening to Q-Tip. [Verse 4: Q-Tip]. Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go. Good times, only difference, niggas making your dough. On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up. You're just a single, cause you wouldn't engage. See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff, beat him in the head. Boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof. Beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof. Oxy in me pulse. He don't want no problem with niggas. Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers.

Kill everything until it's time for me to go. The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me. [Verse 6: Q-Tip]. Incredibly we do it, and it resonates the music. I tune it, YouTube it, it could never ever be refuted. It's gnarly for niggas. and naughty for ninas. Bitches and ballerinas. Ballers and in-betweeners. Blatant non-believers. Kicking it in Pele Adidas. Drink Alize liters. All of you must reconcile a leader. She's begging to eat us, and her man's attitude defeat us. Because me and Bus we're prone to handle, we're gentlemen. [Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]. Not to mention, we're veterans. Better fly, you pelican,. It's never getting no better than this. Watch me turn them to skeletons. Flying, United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette. Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate. You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left. I want to thank you Heavenly Father. For shining your light on me. I want to thank you Heavenly Father.

S"throw your summers in the sky. Collar-pop Jolly Roger die motherfucker die. Apache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion. Snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him. Worm teeth grinding feverishly below. As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow. So when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk. They surface up through the cash crops. With clippers for your belly-up mascots. never dine alone. Meanwhile, back at sea level. it was home by home zone for zone. Bloom County's homeless riot for home ownership. I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads. I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb. As opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb. And that's unevenly rendered. To those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason. But not a reason to surrender. Forty torched orchids and. citronella for Algernon. Don and Vagabond alike repent. This shit should have been Beta burns Babylon, the end. And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors. To murder the medium that shot 'em thirty years before. They said. Kill television. Kill television. Kill television. Difficult isn't it. And when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky. No love lost baby, the future is so bright. Kill television. Kill television. Kill television. Difficult isn't it. Nothing says charm like an armored car. Taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar. We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts. And march through the gauntlet of car alarms. No harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier. Than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears. But we can run with scissors through the city fair. Or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs. Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark. Where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks. These are the vices of the. p-noid bastards. Who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest. But crews lose lunches by the hundreds. Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing. My what a convenient embargo. At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from. But once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide. And that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish. While profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes. The mobile infantry is so postal. Coast into the quotient provoking the local Pistol Pete. cloaking his folk in smithereens. Smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies. Sole defenders of the longest night New York had never slept. Pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers. Who broadcast eighty million versions of the sermon. For that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains. Pale, Arcadian moon, high-definition, flat plasma. IMAX, city-wide transfer. Artificial Einstein-Rosen out the tenement. Ease into the Xanadu. U.F.O.'s and locusts sing the same old song. While the Weathermen get retarded as the day is long. "

S"I ain't no great Samaritan, that's just the way the game goes. Respect the polars but acknowledge middle-value rainbows. My snout turned up from dream factory eyelids. Slinging bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels. Yeah rocks the match that burned his Nazi journals. And plotting verticals amidst blatantly horizontal. Models then swallowed by famished potholes. And I'm tired, tied up on these functions. Killer cotton candy clouds and huckleberry justice league. Another knuckle dragger dungeon breed. Run, breathe, sit, bellow. Wild Aes scream through your style to hear the echo. Aight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback. When Little Billy bought a tugboat. Now he thinks he's Captain Ahab. Fascist, it takes more than peg legs, birds and eye patches. Learn that lesson you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them. Wonder why you wept over spilled milk and got your crayons wet. The room reeks of a thousand bayonets. I'll fission vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian. Connecting life with that little species of idiots. We've now officially scraped barrel bottom. Aesop Rock, an apple to the core but y'all ignored him. I know a planet made of porcelain. And once I get tired of holding this gavel up. Y'all prayer circles met him up born again. I ain't too good for tap water. Play taps out of order for a ballad, corpse a dead man walking. You can lead a man to a city, but that don't assure civility. You can beat a man to death with Aesop Rock bootleg CD's. Some cats float, some cats don't. I speak in Fahrenheit and burn off coal and lyric. Diss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless. Don't dismiss the billy goat appearance for that common sheep. Platforms have been erected. Effigies built. Slogans coined, songs have been written. Rumors have been circulated. Autographs faked. The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape. Moving boxes have been worn out. Mantelpieces dusted. Idols idolized, the sands have been shifted. Curtains have been closed. Sleepers all waked. The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape. Now with my trusty paperclip. I pick locks of thoughts vault. Finding the garden barren. The harvest fruitless. Only the tree of life flourishing. Wanting to take a bite but I'm toothless. Is that predestination or is it by design?. That I'm trapped in time sand. Show radio mission control but for my rhymes. Man because I can like aluminium. And I recycle my consciousness. This is just a note. For any action or lack thereof there's a consequence. Wingless angels. Stroll a top shapeless cotton balls. With halos in your syringe. Celestial ground is found, broken. Exposing a bottomless depth where heartless spines awake to devour the small piece of your soul that's left. You're immersed in sound, floating. Aimless destination. Drop anchor to gain stability. Stare out potions, restrain fertility. Pedestal talk is a token soaked in pockets where lives' topics lack conceptual, ridicule. The night breathes, but light's choking. Darkness occupies the throne where poems are persecuted. The purity at time diluted. Rhymes are executed for genre, I'm told. When has beens attempt to cause heat to rise and wonder why they're trapped in cold. Life's an origami box and I'm hidden within the fold. So when the yarn unravels I won't be caught by surprise. And as society's fabric of orthodoxies dismantle I'll see you embracing the pentagram within this crucifix disguise. See, when the canvas stands before me I'm compelled to spill a vision. For the sinners that listen: I got three spikes and a thorn crown. It seems I need a new soul because mine is worn down. But from the pregnancy of my hardship was born style. Still my pen bleeds and stains the paper with thought. Finding me lost among statues of mainstream idols. Drowning in melted ice, to reinforce that breath is vital. If your father and his father were fish out of water you must break the cycle. How many times must a plant be uprooted, for it to die?. When it's smothered with lies that abolish the potency of the sky. So when the stars burn out and God replaces the bulbs with a million watts. And throws the switch, sparks filament. Herding blue giants and flocks. I stand on my own two, aura illuminated in red. Showcasing the agony held within this welded spirit. Sacrificing itself for the health of a masochistic culture. Yearning for the truth that we speak, but refuse to hear it. "

They kept goin'. Perfect, didn't recognize Slug. Or the effects he'd have when he disrupts the class. Mission bound, twisting around my realm of lost. Cash is expensive, I think I can smell the cost.

Adjustments - they need to be constructed. Adjustments. Ayo Money let's sit down if you've got the time. Cause if you can take the time, I've got some substance on my mind. No I don't really know you, but I know who you are. We've spoke a few times, joked a few times. We even toked a few times. I can remember one time purchasing weed from you once. Yeah, it was worth it. One time we even discussed maybe hooking up and workin'. It didn't happen, but that's not the reason for this. I know I should just get to the point. So let's all get to the point. But let's all get to the point. You may get pissed at what I'm about to spit. Bottom line is mad or not, somebody needs to say this shit. When I'm finished, you might wanna fight. But I don't wanna fight, I've seen you fight. Go ahead, get wild, and I'll still smile for bein' right. See me and mics are like marriage -- makes life complete. And you've been fuckin' with nasal drugs, renders love obsolete. But I'd rather address this here matter. Than have to duck and shun you. It's getting close to harvest, time to count your livestock. It's still within you, I can see it, I think it froze. Cause you keep cooling it off putting winter in your nose. Adjustments, they were made, but not just for the purpose of adaption. Cause that's natural, I'm trying to stay alert to actions. Surroundings became more dangerous. The more familar I became with strangers. And the more I focused on they strangeness. He pinned me down, gave me the right to shut up after I used my voice. Well guess what? Fuck You. And that's all I wanted to say. Go tell your kids about my crew and the next venue we're gonna play. Stressed out, but that's nothing new, everyone is. And it's gonna stay that way cause nowadays that's how we're runnin' shit. Punishment: that's just another fancy way to say it's time to wake up. Fuck your fame, I'm trying to build some game for my man Jacob. That's my son. Some say spittin' image. Same smile, different grimace. When grown, I hope he's never prone to heed the limits. Of life. Life: probably the biggest word I've ever said. That says a lot, cause there's a whole lot of words inside my head. Death almost a quarter deep, still ain't learned to cope.

And wash the previous evening off me. Now out the shower, get dry, shove a q-tip in my ear. Well, what do we have here?. It appears as if a piece of me has got motivation.

And if I sit in one spot I can take \'em all in. Sometimes I even talk, to see if I can make one grin. If not, yo, it\'s cool I ain\'t gonna take it personally. From Anne Landers, to Ani DiFranco to Orphan Annie. I love all women, but most of them just can\'t stand me. I don\'t know, maybe it\'s my hair or clothes. "...or maybe she noticed that you was diggin in your nose...". Either way it\'s okay, I wasn\'t tryin\' to get laid. To check the titles, that my man Michael\'s got me lookin\' for. My visit was short, cause I just couldn\'t feel. That cat behind the counter actin\' like I\'m here to steal. So I dipped back out into a cloud of tattoos. Pierced body parts and colorful hairdos. And I questioned, did Babylon resemble this?. Are we getting any closer to the end of the list?. A sensuous kiss, placed on apoco-lips. We teach them how to make a fist, but not to resist. And I\'m wondering how\'d we find this position. But people are people and I still love \'em, especially the women. Onwards to the coffee shop, maybe Muddies(?) for a refill and some. Sociological studies. See the junkies, while they co-exist with the sobers. All the bugging of eyeballs, the shrugging of shoulders. And that\'s when I saw her, sippin\' a water. I wanna kiss her mom just for having this daughter. Excuse me miss, I don\'t mean to come across strong. But I\'ve been waitin\' a while and you\'ve been taking too long. And she smiled and I began to blush. She asked if I\'d like to go to the bathroom and make some love. And I got visions of us, and the mirror getting steamed. And that\'s the very moment I woke up from the dream. Woke up, got up, near eleven o\'clock. Butt naked except I was wearing my socks. And that\'s cool, cause most the time this floor is cold. Stand up and stretch and look for my soul. In tomorrow I see no promise. And yesterday was like today. . In tomorrow I see no promise. And yesterday was like today. . In tomorrow I see no promise.

Colors blown out around the doctors finger in his brain. With a needle unable to beat him in a fetal position. He crafted a path to escape his condition. Would cling to the white walls of psych halls. In his mind soon bled the words he would speak to the world in time. But not before more injections strapped to the bed. Until the psycho-tropics took hold of the rap in his head. When his wrists released, he wrote tunes you could snoop through. Day of release said, "Depart from me, I never knew you.". "...I-I-I\'m leavin\'!". '

S'Double M, Self Made 3, let\'s go. Folarin in this ma\'fucka. I\'m just talking to you ma\'fuckas. If I don\'t make you niggas proud. Then this should never be allowed. Look, misunderstood, just over heads. Just in your ears, although you deaf. Killing my fitteds with no intent. I groom better. Like I\'m under a goal post, I am too official. Extra point nigga, I forever kick it. As far as lyrics I\'m quite content with celibate living. Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables. And fuck your syllabi, lil nigga been to school. The realest dude in the room in my groove. And all my women come frequently as the summer\'s moon. Keep talking \'bout ambition shit. Brown women, brown liquor, I\'m innocent. And all these bitches don\'t know which body part they gon\' pick. Invite them to my mind but they end up on my dick. Reminiscing upon my man Slick. We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig. As-salamu alaykum though,. try to hit the Jummah. Muhammed said you faking, though. Somebody said "you winning, why BOA pray so much?". I say "you tripping, such winnin make niggas prey on us". Dreams fulfilling they ain\'t capable of. As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup. Tell them niggas we never giving up. And never lose us on this never ending revenue hunt. Folarin in this motherfucker. Uh, I did it for my family. I\'mma take my mama to the Grammy\'s. And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can\'t be. And show her everything that she taught done came in handy. Yeah, everything fine and dandy. Hurricane flow, dropped my album it was Sandy. On another level so they couldn\'t understand me. I guess I gotta take what I want like Meyer Lansky. Shore is \'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back. Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat. You get that? Look like I went diamond where my wrist at. I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause. Let me get that, aw, how you get that far. Cause when I ran out of gas, I had to push that car. And when I ran out of cash I had to push that hard. Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?. I ain\'t even used to look that far, you dig?. I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did. 18 when I took that charge. Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?. New flows and new hoes. Now I\'m switching Ferrari\'s just like I do clothes. I run a business my nigga, I don\'t just do shows. I don\'t just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga. I\'m looking at the plan like this shit might work. But if it don\'t work then this shit might hurt. We made first and goal now we gotta convert. Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert. I\'m tryna break the bank, I ain\'t breaking the news. That negative attention be the reason we lose. Instead of paying bills niggas wanna buy shoes. If it\'s money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?. Give these fuck niggas some fame. 9 times out of 10 they wouldn\'t even sustain. You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain. Until the industry fuck \'em and then they no one again. I always been me, I was never ashamed. I understand that no man\'s path is the same. And when you not lying you?re even harder to tame. If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game. Nigga don?t be a statistic. Have yo main bitch sending me pictures. Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker. Or a time machine to make the process quicker. I ain\'t with the waiting but I stay patient. I take work trips, I don\'t take vacations. I\'m headed to the top where I stay stationed. Yeah, nigga I stay stationed. And I ain\'t with the drama, don\'t look back for that. The flow got more crack than the trap you at. I\'m done with bitter bitches, it\'s a wrap for that. If you\'re a angry bird, it\'s an app for that. I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch. And now I\'m back with a brand new batch. and it feel good when it go like that. I spend quick and make the dough right back, uh. [Verse 4: J. Cole]. This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site. To slit a nigga throat. on sight. Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight. Cole World, zip your coat up tight. I put your soul on nice. Illiterate, the boy don\'t write. Never met a beat that the flow don\'t like, it\'s cold. Young C.O.. L.E. call me Neo. And If I ain\'t the one I\'m the prototype. Woo, insane how I rhyme. All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines. Shame y\'all lying, me I\'m the truth. Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose. Niggas don\'t wanna hang, I\'m the tree, I\'m the noose. You lil pups couldn\'t pee on my roots. Touch the people, oh, I could be a masseuse. Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots. While y\'all foulin\', me I just shoot, Fallon, Jimmy, nigga. Ask for it nice, now it\'s gimmie nigga. Once poor now it\'s plenty, nigga. Still want more, no Demi, nigga. Serve niggas quick like Denny\'s. Got pennies for my thoughts, now look what I done bought. Did the most with what I was taught. A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest, this a helluva start. Cole... World... nigga. '

Noticed Noah was first to "check 1, check 2". Guess who rescued Repunzel. Climbing up her gold weave,. then made her braid her hair like Alicia Keys. Before EPMD met golddiggers fuckin for VISAs. Jezebel and Mona Lisa. Even ran trizz with JFK on Marilyn Monroe...Oh. "Blow the spot with some old school shit" - Rah Digga on Talib Kweli\'s "Down For The Count". "I\'m so old school"- Jay-Z off of "Jigga That Nigga". "I\'m old school like my dad is"- J-Ro on De La Soul\'s "My Writes". "True, that\'s old school"- Yasiin Bey off of "Very Well". "I\'ll bust that old school boom bap all over this map"- Declaime on Lootpacks\'s "Episodes" (x2). "From the old school I consider loyally true" - Big Punisher off of "You Came Up".

Even when Adam and Eve sat by the weed tree. I told Eve, "Please don\'t tell him touch my weed leaves.". But after I showed him Cypress Hill, he loved fire. Then Eve left and became the first lady of Ruff Riders. carraige,. sittin\' on dubs,. Smacked the thouroughbred in the ass and. hit the 3-wheel motion. Since. Frank and Jesse James. street. Had a scoundrel c-walkin\', shootin\' bullets at his feet. Michalangelo. horsehair brushes. Started doing end to end burners. King Midas\' touch. He grabbed my bead necklace now I\'m rockin truck jewels. When lightin\' struck Ben Frank\'s kite and sent currents through. lectric boogaloo. The wop, robot and helicopter on the pavement. Harlem-Shakin\'. Transylvania was flossed out... but the facts have changed. Like, me selling Dracula some platinum caps for his fangs. I had American Indians sending smoke signals with hydro. Giving villages contact matching blunts with Tonto. Spellin S.O.S. with my eyes closed. Even battled Henry the Eighth with my rhyme flow. And made his wives my hoes. I told Jesus that GZA said sandles were feminine. So he copped some shelltoes and suede Timberlands. Remember when KRS ripped Shan? Do ya homework. That was Amadeus playing the Bridge Is Over. Moses parted two tables with a mixer and played great. M. C. Square was his stage name and he rocked gray braids. That was before we could sit and play, Kid N Play. Or Nefertiti rocked the first flat-top fade. But anyway... flip through ya history books. You\'ll see about a million pictures of these infamous crooks. Cunninlynguists!!. '

Then he quit his nine to five, finally his time arrived. When he signed a major label record contract. Don't let money change ya!. His first single was a overnight success hit (success hit). And now he went from wearing rags to the best fits (best fits). All his new acquaintances, gassed his head, taking it. To the point where he lost proper perspective. Started cutting off the people he came up wit (up wit). Ego blown like his soul had been abducted. Though his heart was once real, now material has filled. Up his world, and he couldn't get enough of it. Used to wanna be the best of the rap dons (rap dons). Now his only one concern is going platinum (platinum). And his skills has since decreased, and the inner hunger ceased. Now content, just as long as fame and cash come (CASH come). He's a Big Willie now, rapping bout cars.

Come back to Earth as a cockroach in your tip cup. She said she\'s had it up to here. She\'s gonna call authorities if I don\'t disappear. I love her threats, it rejuvenates my breath. I give her stress for the reaction that it gets. I got a pocket full of clean, handled money. On a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun. In front of everyone she calls me bum. But she notices my absence on them afternoons I don\'t come. So here I am, thorn in her hip. Holding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips. Ignoring the insults and evil eyes. I feed off of \'em, I wonder when she\'ll realize. That she\'s the only reason I visit. The only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence. And if my ship ever comes, I\'ll miss it. Because I\'m getting old and I ain\'t got much left to give it. So there it is and I have to live with it. I had the chance to make a difference, but I didn\'t. In the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water. Thinking: "Damn, I should\'ve been a better father to my daughter". '

S'cosmic clearance. I was injected with sodium pentathol and questioned. I relayed the message the way I was trained to remember it. I told him detonation was definite if he kept at it. My ears popped, the music stopped and I couldn\'t hear shit. [Hook]. Adon olam, asher malach. B\'terem kol y\'tzir nivra. L\'et na\'asah v\'cheftzo kol. Azai melech sh\'mo nikra. [Verse 2: Canibus]. The driver jogged around to the front and opened the door. He said his name was Muhammed Jamal and he\'d be with me till fall. then I swallowed a tablet of Zoloft. The store\'s stereo was playing Feliz Navidad. The last word I heard myself say was a four letter one. He looked me in the eye and said the drama\'s never done. I heard the ringtone of the red phone. Headquarters informed us there was an explosion in the red zone. I rode shotgun, my partner Ramirez drove. GPS control gave us coordinates where to go. I could barely see, smoke was so thick in the air. I was visually impaired and started to get scared. I heard a woman scream, "Help!" but I didn\'t know where. I started screaming back, "I\'m not gonna leave you here". Saying to myself, "Damn, it\'s hard to breathe in here". Searched the rooms one by one like, "fuck my lungs". Ramirez said the fire truck got stuck by the front. And seen her on the floor next to the doorway. I was half unconscious but I just ignored the pain. Helped her to her feet and she had her arm in a brace. I looked her in her eye, she looked into mine, it was strange. Then I blinked for the last time and never saw her again. '

At your local sleazy speakeasy. For any fan of the limelight. In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite. It\'s risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale. With rappers who\'s better off on the cover of Black Tail. Jumpin Jehoshaphat, who\'s that?. Who cats who do magic like "Tell me how you do\'s that". Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko. Thought I might do techno. Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the vet. For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette\'s. Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter. Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter. But uh.... word play since third grade age. Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage". Hip hop Benny Hill. Sip Henny straight. Get every penny, wait, then he chill. , at any rate. My metal face hoes with tongue or \'least eye ring. Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing. Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting. Then the super-villain struck again like lightning. In the same spot (bzzz!) now what\'s the chance of that?. And a name drop like pick the name out the hat. That\'s a known drop from the, liver conniver. Who vote player out the rap game like Survive while I. Drop. degrees. like a nerd cat wheeling ten speed. So way back spin your back and then freeze. While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero. So called rhymers, go call Cleo. While I, steal the show like "thought so, try hikin". Super-duper stars need Ortho Tri-Cyclen. Sometimes the men, mostly from the women. I hear voices saying that\'s the super-villain. (Uhh, I hear voices). Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain. '

S'Masquerading like he got it figured out. Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head. Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt. Left to his devices, those worthless sacrifices. Praying to the altar of himself. Making pilgrimages, thinking he\'s religious. Like he\'s got all the light, and no one else. He takes the unsuspected. Cause he knows they\'re not connected. Virtually real, and commercially appealed. To the lust of all the people where he lives. Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed. Wanting to be intellectual. Drifting from the way she got turned down one day. And now she thinks that she\'s bisexual. Caught up in emotion. Burning up in her devotion. To the king of exploitation in the field. She handed him her virtue. Cause he told her "I won\'t hurt you". So she lay with him to see how good it feels. [Hook]. Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?. Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?. Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?. Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?. Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication. She brought affection home. Into her bed, quickly multiplying. Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head. Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment. Cause everything appears to be the same. They entertain suggestion. Next time just use protection. Desiring to cover up their shame. But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes. To the very antidote to their dilemma. Burning in their lust. Both of them adulterous. He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation. When confronted, blamed his wife. Giving birth to carnal life. Refusing to acknowledge what he done. Now if we can agree with who created us to be. Who says we\'re guilty everyone before his eyes. Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception. Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified. Un-learn everything you know, and let Him teach you. Line upon line, and precept upon precept, say goodbye. To this decaying social system. He wants to know how far we\'re willing to go. If we love him like we say we do. He will try us. Just don\'t regress. Or slip into hopelessness. Once He\'s satisfied His love. He won\'t deny us. [Hook - Shift]. And then He\'ll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?. Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?. And then He\'ll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?. Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?. '

S'As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs. As political landscapes dissolve. As the oily fish spit out their oily prey. Into hospitals that are too expensive that it is cheaper to die. Into lawyers who charged so much that it is cheaper to plead guilty. Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed. Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes. Born into this, walking and living through this, dying because of this. Castrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this. The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God. The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder. There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets. It will be guns and roving mobs. Land will be useless. Food will become a diminishing return. Explosions will continually shape the earth. Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men. And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard. Born out of that. The sun hidden there. Awaiting the next chapter. DOOM from the realm of El Kulum. Separating cell womb to. Melle Mel boom. Revelations in Braille. respiration inhale. view. Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due. Blazing swords trace the haze praise the Lord. Saving Grace, lace your broad she say she bored. A crazy straw, ink. stale dry paraffin. Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison. A Bad Samaritan averaging above average men. Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging. For scraps, perhaps road kill if that. Gift of gab and he flowed ill chrome stiff hat. Known for writing lightning tight lines. off deep ends. Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine. blind lead blind. Need mines now that was this is then, listening. To sizzling officialtons whispering, "Him again". Metal Face Finster playing with the dirty money. Sinister, don\'t know what he saying but the words be funny. Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet. Make her sweat bullets crime pays no benefits. Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates. Three thousand years ago Moses said. Every human being is responsible for his actions. Or thy being is still thy beast, not yet human!. You ought to let your uncle flow. my motorcyle trunk fulls. From 2 1 2 1. lose crumbs to trunks in bundles. Hands down, better than what your mans use to get. Missing wheel you don\'t listen you\'re a feel head. Sitting in the kitchen pissing twitching kissing steel lead. Crime pays no dental nor medical. Unless you catch retirement, county state or federal. You heard like roaring waters in a seashell. If a tree fell you couldn\'t tell from 3 cell. Be real careful, they tell him by the earful. Kids doing skid bids acting out is terrible. Word is bond, fix your clothes put a shirt on. Pants sagging back when you use to meant you had a skirt on. Squirts posing as thuggers and hustlers. El get closer then y\'alls ball huggers and jugglers. Motherfuckers. DOOM is transmitting a message to you. Super fools. I need to use more power. '

The engine oil purr, lights flash to a blur. Speed work through the Earth, make your motor go \'scurrr\'. Tonight at noon watch a bad moon rising. Identities in crisis. conflict diamonds. Blinding, staring at lights \'til they cryin\'. Bone gristle poppin\' from continuous grindin\'. Grapes of wrath in a shapely glass. Ingredients influential on your ways and acts. Zero tolerance to raise the tax. It don\'t matter how your gates is latched. You ain\'t safe from the Danger Jack. Made it way before they made the map. or a G-P-S. This is D-E-F leader. I know where I\'m goin\' even when it\'s dark. being led down that road. You don\'t see that something\'s wrong. Earth\'s spinnin\' outta control. Everything\'s for sale, even souls. Someone get God on the phone. (Hello hello hello hello). Northside, nigga, Southside. (Hello hello hello hello). Shit\'s poppin\' off worldwide. (Hello hello hello hello). [Verse 2: Black Thought]. Between the greenhouse gases. And earth spinnin\' off its axis. Got Mother Nature doin\' backflips. The natural disasters;. 80 degrees in Alaska. You in trouble if you not an Onassis. It ain\'t hard to tell that the conditions is drastic. Just turn on the telly, check for the news flashin\'. How you want it bagged: paper or plastic?. Lost in translation or just lost in traffic?. Yo I don\'t wanna floss; I done lost my passion. And I ain\'t trying to climb; yo, I lost my traction. They makin\' me break. My contents under pressure. do not shake. I\'m workin\' while the boss relaxin\'. Here come Mr. Taxman. He leavin\' a fraction, give me back some. Matter fact, next paycheck, it\'s like that, son. I\'ll fuck around and have to hurt a few men. They probably chalk it up as a disturbing new trend. Should I say "hello" or should I say that "hell is low"?. Am I nigga or a niggero?. I\'m an African American. they sell drugs in the hood. But the man, he move the medicine. He\'ll prescribe you all meds for everythin\'. A little stuffy nose \'til you get some Claritin. You know I\'m hip to it, and it\'s hard to claim the land. When my great-great-great-grands were shipped to it. Look at technology: they call it downloading. I call it downsizing; somebody follow me. Does a computer chip have an astrology. And when it fuck up could it give you an apology?. (Could it?). Should it say "hello" or should it say "goodbye"?. Try to understand how smart and how hood am I. It don\'t matter though. Until we learn that the world don\'t turn right. We all oughta scatter though. I know where I\'m goin? even when it\'s dark. And being led down that road. You don\'t see that something?s wrong. Earth\'s spinnin? outta control. Everything\'s for sale, even souls. Someone get God {got} on the phone. '

Competitions commence the step down. Those involved with peace who know the Soul's down. Can see that the Soul has got a new sound. Pos and Dove is rarely caught not dressed in peace.

Draggin a bag of lonely poem remnants. Short of breath like you're short of fresh. You're a portable mess. Carpetbagger spearheading tear peddeling pretentious art critics,.  orphans. Trying to dismiss those pioneering their fortunes. You're a spectacle. Pushin for pedagogue lacin up paper weights walkin on stilts talking. You touched the hand of God and I'm like. What are all these evils that plagued the hearts of man. By sweet talking border patrol until they fold and let them in. You got your life in a basket before you could say instant classic.

Beanstalk, chalking outlines before figures fly. Walking uphill trying to get down. Prominent ghost town litigate battle pitch darkness. When the light switch hits the artistry circuit board breaker.

Dirty doc stellar space medic. Stoned by the commoners for glowing. Psuedo floaters buy them beats till bloated. Happy trail hitchhikers guide to spanning oblivion. Complete with a thankless 9-5 chapter. You can sign your life after the fact. Wicked soldiers pickin with buddy system. Logistic motors like Noah's ark ticket holders, pivot. All in a days breath. I guess. Sandman here to foreshadow a day when television run over baboon heart transplants. Sketching a glass partially empty till their hand cramps. With an iceman's chance in Dante's dreamland to stand where the fans lamp. But maybe I do. Yeah yeah maybe it's all over. Maybe I won the game before the machine ate my quarter. I mean absorbing attention's a must. You don't wanna be overlooked. Yeah but you don't wanna be looked over too much. One up for the dashed hopes of fifty fishermen who crashed boats. And the angels who never hit bad notes when harmonizing. I'm an armor-plated farmer. I'm an archer rising with a drawn bow. For the karma where the bulls eye clings and argues. Dense, spreads like new names at the writers bench. Either you drink it or sink it, coz there ain't no sitting on the fence. You make me chuckle child, it's Hell's kitchen now, miss.

Those able to speak what I spoke, repeat my quotes. My systematic treatment approach be deep in they throats. I inject the frontal lobe of the brain with a lethal dose. Of unspeakable dope worse than opium smoke. Well-spoken like Washington Post or a Fox News Network host. Scale intelligence like Wechsler Adults. Nonnormative data, brain storage matter couldn\'t capture. A couple years ago they had to put it on Napster. Ressurect Rip the Jacker, rip these rappers. For every second the clock ticks, I\'m a attack ya. B-U-S gets the last laugh before the critical mass. In half the speed of a bulb flash. They ask Canibus, "Will you ever run out of things to say?. How much breath can a man breathe in a day?". People be like "Bis is too ill, keep him away". I\'ve been waitin here longer than Dr. Levinson\'s time equations. Trying to figure out what made men. Was it inflation or are we just a product of the apes then. And because I come from the ghetto that I can\'t adjust. Yeah my disposition was rough. But it turned me into a quick learner, all I need now is some luck. I used to be an undisciplined piece of fecal matter. And question my projected technique as a rapper. I\'ve lost interest in the battle glory and glamour. But I can\'t control Rip the Jacker when he gets amped up. A loud mouth Mau Mau from the Apartheid.

Nobody rep for the skins, they busy cheering them stars. It\'s ironic, it\'s the same for the artists. Rather than buy our songs, they busy cheering the stars. A lot of drama, a lot of beef. We have so much in common, starting at the feet. Goadome Nikes,. the cortazone of the poem writer. None like us, so none like us. This where the haters is, this why they hate us here. This why I hate it here, though love it, I made it here. We all here, from the dealers to the kids. To the squares to the fly,. one thing we are aligned with. Black on black Nikes. that represent the lifeless lives. And it reflects the plight of those fighting so. If we ain\'t right and always at the throats. Of one another at least we got our Goadome Nikes. A metaphor, for the insecure. If you ain\'t wearing no color, can\'t nobody say nothing. One can never be judged when he dress like his brothers. Melancholy we are though we all learn to love it. Pessimistic we are, carry odds like luggage. And thru all our troubles, we still walk around walk around. And still got my Nike Boots. '

Versace, banana color robes and my socks be. Them Billie Jean shits and they real rocky. I bench Coliseums while Genius spot me. Plus I\'m cocky, bitch.

I\'m sorry I took so long, didn\'t mean to make ya\'ll wait. But good things take time to create. Half baked, eatin\' ganja cake. Tryin\' to make my next release date. With Ghost, Street, GZA, great minds relate. You know a brother bond is hard to break. When we perform we cause the Earth to shake. Ain\'t nuthin\' change, it\'s still those same niggas you love to hate. I set examples over amplified samples. That was stolen by new thieves. The journalist watched it, critics couldn\'t knock it. A piece of history that they carried in their pocket. With the time factor, speed was the order of the day. What a delay, they were able to, what he would say. Why waste the slot time, of the ridiculous rhyme. That\'s only excused by a generous mind. I kept \'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans. \'Til I turned rap fields into harvested lands. '

Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?. And holds mics like he knows karate body blows?. Nobody knows. The trouble I see. From the MPV fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty. For the record this is some shit I just thought of y\'all. Science fiction that\'s not admissable in no court of law. I live to rock mics 3-D. The only reason I seek to stop: to snuff the TV. I heard beats, they sound like karaoke. With monkey rhymers on a leash like don\'t have this fairy choke me. Hit \'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts. And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts. They locks Lex Luthor up in green haven. Since when a nigga never really been to clean shaven. Misbehavin rap stars need Listamint. Mista Bent. I\'m at where your sister went. Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke. Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell (HEY!), tell a joke. Bout to stop the violence. Right after these last three shots from the black bat got me at headlock. Holdin on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock. She told me get off I said:. "Bitch!!. Then it hit me like the point of intoxication. A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation. In the world\'s most strangest most dangerous occupation. But you could do it, you the Super like in your building. Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children. With some real mature womens, and more of they friends. when bad men roll tight, it\'s actual true. a pack of Big Bamb?, with natural glue. Who grip necks of Becks next to triple X?. He just came in 4D: Follow the ripple effects!. And it\'ll lead you right to him. Zoinks!. pretender willies. get broke off! like end of Phillies. True believers. Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh-. Rhyme of the month two page long. Bustin off two gages with my cape on wrong. Son it\'s on remind me of a Raekwon tape song. With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong. National and geographic down to the titty-bar. Rep Monster Island City yall. all my brothers who is doin\' unsettling bids.

Hated, and some say it\'s the things I say or how I say em. And I admit, in this race I tend to struggle to relate in words. It\'s like I\'m an alien who alienates by the herd, so as far as being heard. I guess I gotta wait,. deprived by the station\'s eye. Wale, more times than not, am not for whom the air waves. Thank God for the free thinkers, for you keep me in mind. In this state of mind that I\'m in, for you keep me in the race with the baton that y\'all give. And they hypebeasts,. street wear,.

Imma say it to y\'all, I\'m gonna put my faith in y\'all when I don\'t understand me. They say I\'m running hip-hop but I\'d rather unify with y\'all then stampede. And lastly for everybody who doubted I can\'t live without you, please. Continue to inspire the fire that is my re-dedication to greatness y\'all. Paint A Picture. to A.D.. to freestyles to famous songs we out \'chere. Unforgettable gestures, unmeasurable effort, to pleasure the masses with impeccable work ethic. no days off. Pain on my face, laying back rolling a J. Feeling like these rap niggas ain\'t as real as they say. That\'s why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested. Resented by the game like I\'m Pete Rose in this bitch. Ain\'t nothing stopping us, tell u what the problem is. I\'m on top of my game but these niggas won\'t acknowledge it. So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus. So, to stop us better take it in blood like a phlebotomist. [Seinfeld Skit]. I walk around understanding the politics.

Now I\'m taking these pills and I ain\'t even sick. Ice and Rain, Letter, Center of Attention. I wanted them on my debut, but they ain\'t wanna listen. You know I love my team, but they couldn\'t see my vision. Interscope is my fam, so I ain\'t tryna make no issue. I\'m just trying to paint that picture, when I\'m rhyming up in this booth. I\'ma try to rhyme and get through, I\'m documenting the truth. Men lie. Women lie. Numbers won\'t forsaken. The only album flop is the album niggas hate so. A.D. 2, on the way, let\'s do this. And God willin\' niggas gonna triple up them units. Triple up them units,. wisdom is improvin\'. If no one\'s there to listen guess I\'ll put it in the music.

Mothered my blessed kid, but was destined to exit early. Guess you can say I've been blessed with the best gifts. Reminiscing, holding her necklace in my clenched fist. Ha,. it's funny how we move in sudden directions. Dedicated my life to the public's protection. Never remarried cause love's an investment. Besides, I had a baby girl to worry about. That would struggle to blend in. Now as I think, a weightlessness is interrupting my senses. A pulsing tension carries my very frame. I rise up in ascension - WAIT!. I try to escape, but I arrive at these gates. figure. standing guard who invites me to pray. [Verse 2: Tonedeff]. I walk towards the figure that's extending its hand. I move to enter past the gates yet I'm met with its grasp. Slow down son, there's things to discuss such as family. But first, let us talk about vanity. Vanity?? Man, you're sadly mistaken. Either that or your sanity's shaken. If you'd examine me patiently. You'd retract on your statement. I haven't sinned flagrantly. I've acted as faithfully. As any other single father. Who raised a baby girl graciously. Nakedly, she was at your door after her mother's death. Ignorant to racial anger and other stress. Later had a mixed baby at her sweet sixteen. How did that fit within your picnic scene?. Sometimes it's too late to fix these things. The pristine dream was over. Had to face the fact she split these genes with his sick seed. With skin the darkest pigment seen. And so I kicked and screamed. Until we found the peace that distance brings. A mixed raced queen, that was your thoughts about her mama. Up yonder went her soul, your hate growed from ponders. On life, being less trife with a white wife. Oh my, it's not her race, my daughter's love flies blind. I couldn't take her making the same mistakes that crushed my life. I'm dumbstruck by these baseless allegations. I've saved too many lives of all creeds. For you to paint me as a racist. I've endangered my own safety to save babies from blazes. Black, white, latino, even asian on occasion. But why so?. How dare you question my motivation!. No need to second guess, your only aim was to be famous. Lord knows, you've left behind scorched souls. Black children left chilling, later found burnt whole. So sadly, your glory's to come urgently. Sentenced to fight fires for eternity. "

Never met a quiet storm. That didn\'t grow into a choir of colliding horns. That go "click click clack" in territorial syntax. Sitting on the porch with his lids pinned back. Pinball whiz. in a thimble of Sims. I\'m a symbol of whimsy abridged. Kiss Me, I\'m Dead; nursing a mystery, DayQuil. Led Zep staring daggers down page mill. How pray tell do he sit pretty?. When the old one-two unglue in a tizzy. Please hold for the don\'t-play dull boy. Click: I am not a page or a pull toy. Came in the door and the floor is lava. Killjoy if your core more Norman Rockwell. Born homesick for an invisible address. batshit. Bumble and bat around catnip. One black-heart Katamari massive. Packed in a fat category-5 rat nest. Nose on his sleeve. holes in his inner peace. Robot phone like a tentacle of flippancy. I hate you (I hate you more). No, I hate you infinity. And Pangaea break into smithereens. Interlude presto change-o. If it move too quick (oh whey oh). Right brain go write train Ramo. Mustache any old Monet, (no). Yes. Merrily merrily merrily merrily. In a cobweb tomb on a hotbed of heresy. Frogmen schooled by the god Ed Emberley. Pull dog sleds and exhume Dead Kennedys. Bet: moth into kerosene awful. A caution to straw men lost on Vaudeville. Amorally mixing business. With 144 Dixie Whistlers. Lawnchair strongman twisted whiskers. NASCAR Bic in his missing fingers. Outcast from a system of kiss-the-ring-ers. Are you privy to the misadventures?. It\'s electric, meeting in the middle of the street. With a lethally modified Piccolo Pete. There is admittedly an incredible mystique. To meddling in the reason a city won\'t sleep. 48 strings of twelve. That ring ring ring whiz-bang jingle bells. And melt bootleg G.I. Joes to black taffy. Classic fire-in-the-hole backdrafting. Fold wildlife out of Wolf Pack wrapping. Full moon, bad knee, wool hat, caffeine. TNT plunger in all-caps ACME. Blast off half of the whole damn mapscreen. No sling no spear. I\'m a patchwork of 86\'d springs and gears. Who been stung by an unlinked pinky swear. During his what-in-the-fuck-was-I-thinking years. Maybe an awkward phase. Like his acne and sophomore fade, played. Calling all out-of-work action figures. It was death by Saturn Missiles. '

S"When I was just a sperm cell in the fallopian tube. In the midst of a state of triple darkness. Going through a struggle so I could exist. Avoiding everything that came within my path. As I watch other sperm cells get ripped in half. One out of a million completes the job. And for the other sperm cells the womb is a graveyard. Though my travels I had to pass through. A lot of battles and violent hassles. Cuz' inside the womb I was a foreign object. I'm like a new nigga walking through the project. Trouble, everywhere I turn. Damn its a struggle just being a sperm. Cell. , so I attempt to prevail. I guess the womb is the first stage of hell. Now here I am in the danger zone. My head and my tail, my 23 chromosomes. But then again yo it can't be that bad cause my dad. He could have used a body bag. And if so then my tomb would have been the trash can inside my mom's bedroom. But they was fucking, they was true to this. And here I go on a mission to the uterus. A million motherfuckers tried to race ahead. But I was the one that fertilized the egg. Then I thought then I was safe. Because I reached home base. But oh no my job wasn't done. In fact my troubles had only begun life is a struggle. Life is the struggle. Life is the struggle. Cmon. See the. joy of life beginning. See the joy of. life beginning. Oh sweet joy!. A brand new baby boy. "

They couldn't match up with the fly nigga with his back against the wall. Heads clapped once I came in the door. I played the speaker, sipping a Kahlua. Saw this bad bitch wit a switch and yo, I had to step to her. rather wished the current was warm. When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on. Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself. Yo, I'm the man, and honey, you've been rated top shelf. Yo, what's your name hon. hair wrapped up in a bun. Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun. Never diss 'em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss 'em. Especially, when you're browsing, going fishing. Your waistline, banging like a bassline. Physical form is well complex. And yo, I love your outline, boo. Your whole body is wild, with your rugged profile. Enough to make a hard rock smile. You can't strike out, tell me what can really go wrong. You're rocking labels - Tommy Hil, down to Claiborne. Show me some love hon, show me some love boo. Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through. A-yo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret. And loving all the marvelous slang on how I freak it. Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash. Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass. Your body lotion is the potion. The shit got me open like dust. and yo, your stee is Thai potent, yo. We can go the distance. I put you under wings. From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings. I walked the hot Arabian desert, barefooted. I grabbed your hand, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it. joint. It be the Wu-Tang production. "

S'The tv screens follow the homicide scenes. You live here, you?re taking a chance. So look and I take one glance, there?s a man inside an ambulance. I wonder how the. People want to go fight for the white powder. People hanging in spots. They waited until the blocks got hot and got raided by the cops. I?ll explain the man sleeping in the rain. His whole life remains inside a bottle of Night Train. Another man got his clothes in a sack. Cause he spent every dime of his rent playing blackjack. Sonya has pneumonia. So why?s her mother in a club pulling zippers?. Yo that?s her job, Sonya?s mommy is a bar stripper. Drug dealers drive around looking hard. Knowing they?re sending their brothers and sisters to the graveyard. The pushers and pimps eat shrimps. It gets tiring, the sound of a gun firing. Then there\'s desire for the sound of a siren. Upstairs I cover my ears in tears. The man downstairs must have drank too many beers. Cause every day of his life he beats his wife. Till one night she decides to pull a butcher knife. Blind man plays the sax. A tune called ?The Arms on My Moms Show Railroad Tracks". Many lives are cut short. A young girl is undressed in the back seat of a caddy. Calling some man daddy. Three men slain inside an apartment. All you could see was the sparks when it darkened. Daylight broke, cops roll on the scene. The drug war, daily routine. Gambling spots, just a poor man?s jackpot. You winning a lot, you get shot. Shoot-outs for a desire for territory. A tired mother can?t take no more. She grabbed a bottle full of sleeping pills and took about 24. Human beings are laying on the pavement. Cause they?re a part of a mental enslavement. People scouting a torched-out building. And got killed when the cold air filled in. A little kid says "Yo. I got a color tv, cd player and car stereo. And all I want is a capsule. I also got a .38, don?t give me no hassle". One kid heads straight for the top. And gets stopped and popped by a crooked cop.

S'Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she\'d draw upon the street. The many faces of the various locals that she would meet. There was Joshua, age 10, bully of the block. Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop. There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle. She always gave a wave and holler. On her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor. And she drew. Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds. And she drew. Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns. Always said hello to passersby. They\'d ask her why she passed her time. Attaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile. Now all the other children living in or near her building. Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants. They would say. "Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?". Lucy would pause, look, grin and say. "I\'m busy, thank you much". Well, well, one year passed. and believe it or not. She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk. And she stopped-. "Lucy, after all this, you\'re just giving in today?". She said:. "I\'m not giving in, I\'m finished," and walked away. 1-2-3, that\'s the speed of the seed. You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream. I\'d rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it. Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat. Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in. She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip. Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks. And she drew. Little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch. The mailman, delivered everyday at 4. Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day. But she found it suitable, and she liked it that way. She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit. They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose. They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too. So they\'d connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew. Now every month or so, she\'d get a knock upon the front door. Just one of the neighbors. Acting nice although she was a strange girl, really. Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?". Lucy would smile and say "I\'m busy, thank you much". And they would make a weird face the second the door shut. And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was. And Lucy knew what people thought but didn\'t care. Cuz while they spread their rumors through the street. She\'d paint another masterpiece. Lucy was 87, upon her death bed. At the senior home, where she had previously checked in. Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest. Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen. And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn. Had a television in the room that she\'d never turned on. Lucy pinned up a life worth\'s of pictures on the wall. And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all. No Rico, he had passed, about 5 years back. So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock of nothing. She\'d never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life. "Look, I\'ve never had a dream in my life. Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven\'t pursued. I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done. So I\'ve been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!". Well!. The nurse jumped back. She\'d never heard Lucy even talk. Especially words like that. She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind. Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures. And she died. '

And her decision making skills were still in its early stages. You know what I'm talking about. Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which. She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood. Pause,. Should I, shouldn't I, I can't, I have to, Mama will never see me the same. Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me. Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium. As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house. The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue. And no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life. Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose. Fatality, fatality, fatality, fatality. "

It all falls down. Y\'all can\'t handle the truth in a courtroom of lies. Perjures the jurors, witness despised. Crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized. Its entertainment...the arraignments. The subpoenas. High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas. Enter the Dragon. Black-robe crooked-balance. Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents. Court reporter catch the circus on the paper. File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker. Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous. Publicly perpetrating that "In God We Trust". Cross-examined by a master manipulator. The faster intimidator. Receiving the judge\'s favor. Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors. For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers. See the bailiff. Representing security. Holding the word of God soliciting perjury. The prosecution. Political prostitution. The more money you pay, the further away solution. Legal actors. Babylon\'s benefactors. Masquerading as the agency for the clients. Hypocritical giants. Morally non-compliant. Orally armed to do bodily harm. Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm. And the defense isn\'t making any sense. Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence. That a defendant is depending on the system. Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em\'. Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen. Framed by intentions. Inventions whereby they lynch men. Enter the false witness slandering the accused. the seed. Expert witness (the paid authority). Made a priority to deceive the majority. Of disinterested peers. Dodging duty for years. Hating the process. Waiting to be returning to their careers. Do we expect the system made for the elect. To possibly judge correct?. Properly serve and protect?. Materially corrupt. Spiritually amuck. Oblivious to the cause. Prosperously bankrupt. Blind leading the blind. Guilty never defined. Filthy as swine. A generation purin it\'s own mind. Blown out of proportion. In vein deceit. The truth is obsolete. Only two positions: victimizer or victim. Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system. Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma trying to own a piece of the "American Corona". The Revolving Door. Insanity every floor. Skyscraping, paper chasing. What are we working for?. Empty traditions. Reaching social positions. Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?. When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief. The standard is Thief. Brethren can we candidly speak?. Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom. Confusion consumes them. Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white. Internally they absent of light. Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night. Under the curse. Angelic being cast to the earth. It\'s time for rebirth. Burnin up the branch and the root. The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit. Turn and be healed. Let him who stole, no longer steal. Oh it\'s real. Surrender for Jehovah is real. How long will you sleep. Troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep. The. idols. YOU heap. Causing the destruction you reap. Judgment has come. Find it and return to the One. Abandon the flesh. Self-interest: Broadway to death. Pride and the Greed. Hide and subdividing the seed. The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie. Caused us to die. Let your emotions be crucified. Renounce all your thoughts. Repent and let your mind be re-taught. You\'ll find what you sought...was based on the deception you bought. A perception of naught. Where the majority remains caught. Loving a lie. Not realizing in Adam, all die. Loving a lie. Not realizing in Adam, all die. Loving a lie. Not realizing in Adam, all die. Loving a lie. Not realizing in Adam, all die. '

You\'re not all that fly, trying to play the role. I had girls that looked better on the ho stroll. Working night patrol. I get cash and still wear Jordache jeans. You thought your drug-dealing man was much better. Because he always came and got you in a plush Jetta. Or a Audi, a Benz, or a Jaguar. You didn\'t think G Rap was going that far. I\'m here to tell off, because you thought I fell off. And now if you\'re riding the tip, just get the hell off. You wanted to leave because you didn\'t believe that I would achieve. Cause you had something up your sleeve. Perhaps you might have thought I\'m a dreamer with a fat head. Now you\'re stuck with a baby from a crack head. Come to my shows, you want to check it to see if I wreck it. The only record your man got is a jail record. I know you like him a lot because he\'s a big shot. The only picture you got is his mug shot. I\'m on a label with well-known singers in it. Look, your man\'s getting booked and fingerprinted. Polo drives a Benz from state to stae. By the way, guess who made his license plates. Thought I was finished, down, going through the blues. Here\'s a hundred dollars, go buy some new shoes. Go ahead good looking, you can keep booking. never get my title tooken. So you got a little 9 to 5, so what?. What do you do for a living, slice cold cuts?. You look slick, but you know every Tom and Dick. You\'re more quick than a chick from a porno flick. While you scrub floors, I go on tours. From me, G Rap, yo, truly yours. Listen up money, or should I say honey?. You\'re looking more sweeter than a Playboy bunny. Fingernails filed, your hair is styled. And the gear that you wear looks hot and wild. Everybody says is he, some kind of sissy?. Your name was "Moose" but now they call you "Missy". Night or day lights, you fight for the gay rights. Len, your real close friend. But you wouldn\'t be his friend if his knees didn\'t bend. You\'re not a lady dear, you\'re a square and a queer. Barrettes in your hair, bamboos in your ear. Running to cars. hanging out in gay bars. guys that wear bras. Skintight Levi\'s and even knee-highs. Don\'t try to lie, sugar, I know why. In the ladies bathroom. Stuffing your t-shirt with two balloons. You don\'t think about the opposite sex at all. Instead of sugar walls, you\'d rather have the balls. Way back in the days, you was as big as a cow. But look at you now, at jams you say "Ow!". A sex disease was as common as TB. But gays today get VD in 3-D. And that is called AIDS in case you didn\'t know. And the only blow I\'m giving is this knockout blow. Switching with your bandana looking like Diana Ross. Go to the Wizard of Oz and get some self-respect. Moby Dick, there she blows. And you run up behind me trying to get pregnant by me. Yo, you used to tell me all the time you\'re gonna be a model. Later in life, you\'re living in a crack bottle. I\'m clocking G\'s. You\'ll be in zero degrees getting processed cheese. Now I\'m down with Warner Brothers getting Bugs Bunny money. '

True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale. Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail. Bondsman to go on and post that bail. You would be happy as hell, you thought you was happy. Until that court date came couldn't abort that case. Nobody to take your place, family members at stake. Too late to escape and get on the run. Once upon a rhyme one time when I was a child. (Flip that smile upside down now!). When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli. It was silly, cause my mom and pop they worked for every penny. Didn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly. Only to start the New Year off in debt. Now you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dad's relationship. Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the hot sauce!. 1979, Dirty South, local lounge.

S'I\'m relieved that I saw the speed trap before he saw me. I don\'t need another ticket, I\'ve gotta collection in the glovebox. They make great souvenirs cause they weigh less than rocks. Man you better slow your roll, let the numbers get low. Like a 55 stroll to move past the patrol. Hope he don\'t already know about my top speed. Like the helicopter radar that caught me outside of Milwaukee. I\'m still livin this life, tryin to escape the problems. It\'s the gas fumes, the fast food, yo its all of the above. It\'s meetin\' women for a weekend and fallin deep in love. But ain\'t nuthin\' like bathin\' in a freezin\' river naked. Cause I stole it off the side of the road. Pull the car behind the brush and get in touch with your farm land. So if and gotta healthy lookin\' garden in your backyard. I\'ll pull over to admire then I\'ll check for a dog. And if the area is clear I\'ll be back here tonight. Set dinner for one under the moonlight.... [Hook (but spoken and layered)]. Discovered that, I really don\'t know much, most of much of what. I know catches a, "what?" to my surprise (X2). It\'s been about a month since I left St. Paulie Girl behind. Punctured the heart but it was for her own good. Left her sittin\' in the kitchen with the breakfast dishes. And gave a name to this distance that she never would\'ve understood. And if you buy my tape it puts work on my odometer. 10 bucks\'d take me 300 kilometers. Runnin from myself won\'t stop until I pop. So keep an eye open for me at your local record shop. '

S'No ground wires, all jaw froth. Mouth-breathing outliers climb out of mothballs. Wrung stones unsung and alone. Known to run up in the unknown, "honey I\'m home". I push a bucket of bolts,. assorted death in his wake. I take the hand off the thief, I take the head off a snake. Approach a pen like revolution\'s just a sentence away. \'Til then he\'s documenting cops and watching Heaven decay. It\'s not a gentleman\'s game it\'s a generation braced accordingly. Who know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine. Yes y\'all the crestfallen careworn. Air horn, air horn, air horn, air horn. Not a dollar, watching Rocky 2 in Donatello boxers. At some hot-as-hell motel in what\'s supposed to be his Shangri-La. Not even a baby doll to change his gauze. Not even a hideaway to hide up in. A side effect of sliding environment to environment. Driving isn\'t simply when the tires spin, try again. Departures and arrivals aren\'t only time and mileage. Try again again, a raider break off from the phalanx. And never look back, never cook crack, K - thanks, bye. New York in the rear view then peel. Out, \'til he found New York in the windshield. This was never an effective way to rally insurgents. Or really even the occupation of a rational person. When you write about seclusion and some buyers finally tune in. You get frightened finding happiness can drive away the movement. In a jiffy,. just eat your food and keep the future iffy. That fruition\'s for the viewers who need a loser to pity. Plus an underlying message of a greater disconnection. God forbid he try to live or gain momentum. You\'d rather see him eat a bowl of mouse traps. Surf a thousand couches. Take a jagged little down the hatch. Chowderheads. I know you love the way the failure flounder. Maybe I could be your daily downer. If his brain left his body and was headed for the door. Would you take it in and help it find its way into a jar?. No? fuck it, let him hop around a maze. We can see who\'s really lost when the schadenfreude fades. '

Go back to Jerz. My funk respect it, cosmic injected. There's a million and one blunt spots all over the world. That got the good herb for all you boys and girls. And I, set the world on fire. Get a billion people higher, from just one blunt in my cypher. The rhymer bomb squads and MC's like Hank Shocklee. From fifteen to fifty-fifth I ran all through the blocks. That's doing three flat. You can't fuck with my funk cause my funk is kinda abstract. McGruff. nouns from antonyms to synonyms. Cause I got soul like James Brown and Rakim and them. America's Most Blunted. Smoked out with MC Eiht and Compton Most Wanted. Ninety degrees, smoke with L.O.D. on the Island. Then back to Stat, to smoke more packs with the Shaolin. I showed the women how to roll a blunt stronger. But it didn't work because they Lee nails got longer. But the weed is good for when you're macking. And girls can front it off like they don't know shit that happened. Leave you on your back like Godzill did Gamera. I might catch a nickel bag sale from bus stops. "

Trying to guess which shell living hell sleeps under. When the grand scheme plan keeps all these people wonderin. Why we still runnin in place frustrated?. Pride is mistaken for hate, it\'s upgraded. I got a little breath left, let\'s suffocate it. Point at the epiphanies and call \'em all drug related. The time I spent with my life on bent. Trying to find the friends inside my head. Must have disengaged every phase and stage. Of of my I\'m coming, I\'m coming, I\'m coming of age. My unofficial autobio. Will be accompanied with tips on how to smile. Cause I\'ve found that when they don\'t see you frown. They never know that you\'re a threat. And they don\'t sweat you when you came around. So who\'s going to be my next door savior?. Step up to your neighbor, and do me a favour. Take off the mask, let it all collapse. Empty the pack and watch your wings grow back. Society becomes jealousy. intimacy becomes intensity. Say it with a smile like it\'s meant to be. And all of a sudden, "boom", American family. And I can tell when your mad at your past. Because you tend to take the turns just a little too fast. And I can tell how you push your foot on the gas. That you already knew that you was gunna finish last. Slow it down and take a little time. To look up at them clouds with the fake silver lining. Up in a tree knowing damn well you never reach the top. But you don\'t stop, you keep climbing. Well okay, it\'s settled. No more nights in this weed and thorn infested meadow. Uh-uh, from this day forth,. only forward I pedal. Get the memo I\'m cutting the strings Gepetto. Shuffle the cards and let\'s argue. Rooted in between the computer games and cartoons. Stop and watch us all get lost. Between God and a shot of scotch, let\'s get fly. '

Cause I don\'t know how to swim, but I project the image, that i\'mma go all in. Got it under control, until I grow my fins I\'m still plugging my nose. No surprise, stolen by the tide. You can close your eyes. But the hopes stay alive, and the crow gonna fly. Quick to tell you that she don\'t need a man. From what I\'ve seen I completely understand. Can\'t stand a cat that try to make demands. Plus her man said he sick of bringing beach to the sand. Quickly sinking in the holiest boat. Figured he might as well drink just to keep it afloat. Nope, when small things end up being gigantic. Relationships go the way of the Titanic. Why panic?. Have some fun while it last. Be happy that you even had a spot on the cast. Moving fast don\'t mean it won\'t end quick. Why put your toes in when you can skinny dip. Remember when you\'re with the prettiest chick. There\'s another man that\'s sick of putting up with her shit. There is a temperamental magic in the key of love and war. It go, "nothing up her sleeve not even a fucking arm". Body ain?t a temple if it?s disassembled parts. East coast tilt kings raised by servals. Pacing up the grape vine nervous. Poke jarred brain matter adequately curious. Pick a perfect patsy, herd ?em back into the turnip truck. Where a high arch pose as the nobles. Fine yeti fur with a dire prognosis. He prefer to mire with the openly grotesque. Opening in a cold discotheque coat check. Oh my low-tech bolt neck, go time, no myth. I\'m a slow death goldmine. '

We\'ll meet up at your place. I sting like a first divorce, or them first Newports. Whatever hurts you more. "You\'re headed for self destruction" been there, did that. Kicked back with the wrong angel to fuck with. Carved my charm into your arms. Fuck around, unravel this tall ball of yarn. From the plantation to the reservation to the farms. Only guarantee in life is death or a headfuck. I got a few blocks left before I reach my destination. Just to let me know, she wouldn\'t ever let me go. Smart went crazy, the rubber band went snap.

Barnumed in 3D THX sound stereo dismissal. Sorry hun, it\'s just the last few have been a fistful. Like.. like them girls you bump into out dumb luck. Get high and innocently kiss once when she\'s punch drunk. Watch her misinterpret the moment tongues touch. Crazy McCling-a-lot claim instant one love. And you\'ve gotta beg your friends to take \'em off your hands like thumbcuffs. Or them barbies you\'ll vibe for a sexy second (lovely). Give it a month Hyde heckles Jekyl and she makes Hitler look cuddly. But Jenny in the sky with emerald eyes. You\'re so different so delicious so the fish. I\'d be willing to walk the limb with. So let\'s just get a few things out the way: (okay). I\'m clinically bonkers and hate just about everyone God\'s great earth offers. I won\'t be getting dressed up to impress your family dear. And if I can\'t wear jeans and sneakers then I won\'t be lamping there. Nope, aggro-pimp, sinfully, finicky nova, bag it up no-diggity soldier. Magic touch fingertip donor. Own up to your dirty debutante animalistic instincts. Ritual courting dance and breeding behaviors (like what?). I dream of Jeannie and fucking her obsecenly. But Jenny could be Jeannie so easily if you\'d let me. Hell, the bad tact daddy-o Merlin-- \'e\' for effort. Dinner and cinema, yes, just cough the bread up. Sure, he schleps with a naked pocket but I carry dreams. Like I wanna be an astronaut after you marry me". "You\'re rushing this. I feel smothered it\'s crowding me awfully". Dolly, I love you, "Get the fuck off me!" Sorry.. And I\'m circling her like a tiger shark frenzied but friendly. So quiet, oh I like that, so mysterious, I dig it. The way you haven\'t made eye contact with me once in ten minutes. I\'m just saying girl, I\'m dirty-dog raw vintage mixed with mega-low society. Mister gutter-fuck etiquette - try me!. So there it is, game.. I mean it\'s not like I\'m sweating you. Because when it comes down to it, most of y\'all females are the same. But now it\'s your turn baby, spit it out". She punched me dead in the fuckin mouth and walked away. Watch out ladies cause you know he don\'t love ya. Bazooka Tooth is one bad motherfucker. He\'s a low life pimp with a low life game. He needs a no life dame with a strobe light frame. No ring on the finger. There ain\'t no strings attached. But if you love television and. Manic depression. Get a carton of cigarettes. And we can make it happen. Get to mackin\'. Just leave your baggage on my curb with the trashcans. It ain\'t like I seen you in Maxim. Relax with the tap dance. Lights, camera, lap dance!. '

To the life of indecision build a dreamscape prison. Where light isn?t manufactured but captured inside a prism. In a state between asleep and awake. Feels closest to hypnosis where the infinite wait. Then the fog dissipates revealing crimson fields. Crept on by a fawn with flaming heels. Eyes red as stop signs and a mane of quills. As it gaze past hills of diamond trees. I see a silhouette rest upon golden knees. For the body of a goddess and a face of dreams. A half-naked Meagan Good in a pagan hood. It wasn?t Heaven that I was seeking but a haven I sought. A canvas of the mind painted with my thoughts. I wake up to find I?m inside of a dream inside of a dream. See buried deep beside the seams of my screams. Of beings and otherworldly things rarely seen. Might be psychosis or maybe I chose this. The night approaches every time the eye closes. I see a burning bush, feel like I?m Moses. Burn so much kush I feel like amosis. All my images are morgues and wounds. And every fork in the road moves through Freud and Jung. In the darkness no orchard blooms. A state so dark, sparks from the torch is consumed. It?s like I live in a fortress of doom. In the forest where the blood pores were forced from my wounds. Ashes are burning brightly. The smoke can be seen from afar. So now you?re seeing how far. Ashes are burning the way. '

S"Forever watchin' his back, therefore he never relax. And when her nigga attack, he got a slug in his britches. Her reputation was dirty, but yo that didn't disturb me. I want to stop the insanity, try to have me a family. Started checkin' my phone and brought her back to reality. Left her ring on the dresser, adios motherfucker. I'm travelin' home from the road, I hear she fuckin' with Usher. Now Usher don't even know me but I got love for the homie. Even though everybody around me be thinkin' he corny. So I'm off to Miami, got invited to party. By Mr. Raymond himself, yo I ain't hatin' nobody. And when she seen it was X, she started cryin' and trippin'. And dude was lookin' confused, the scene it couldn't be written. Now he just pluckin' his chickens, I ain't gon' sock him or diss him. A little over-dramatic, in Rome I called him a faggot. In front of millions of people, funny but shouldn't have done that. I was makin' a joke, I didn't mean to offend. Like when I introduced Destiny's Child as Boyz II Men. "

S"The impact pushed back, the first five rows. But before the raw live shows. I remember I's a little snot-nosed. Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes. Learning the ropes of ghetto survival. Peeping out the situation I had to slide through. Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too. When it came to getting mine I ain't trying, to argue. Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you. Hip-hop, you the love of my life and that's true. When I was handling the shit I had to do. It was all for you, from the door for you. Speak through you, getting paper on tour for you. From the start, Thought was down by law for you. Used to hit up every corner store wall for you. We ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you. I remember late nights, steady rocking the mic. Hip-hop you the love of my life. Hip-hop, you the love of my life. [Verse 2: Common]. I was speaking, to my guy 'Riq and. How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion. Using no protection, told H.E.R. on Resurrection. Caught up in the Hype Williams. and lost H.E.R. direction. Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R. An under the counter love, so silently I treat H.E.R. Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed. In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff. When we touch, it was more than just a. fuck. The Police. In H.E.R. I found peace. Like Malcolm in the East. Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, tricking off. Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft. Movin weight, losing weight. Not picky with who she choose to date. To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate. Close to thirty. Most of the niggas she know is dirty. Having more babies than Lauryn. She started showing early. As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate. Or destiny that brings the best of me. It's like God is testing me. In retrospect I see she brought life. and death to me. Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform. It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes. Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube. Now the fight moved to in life, making the right moves. Besides God and family, you my life's jewel. Like that y'all. Fifth Dynamite. Fifth Dynamite, and it sounds alright. "

Tie you up like bikes to a rail in with a little cheap chain. LAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMEEEE!!!!. "Aiyyo what you cut it off for? Don\'t you see what I\'m doin to this?!". The question everywhere is "you getting on the remix?". Cause this is something that I fathered and mastered. And plastered \'til they started calling me sick bastard. I\'m drastic when it comes to reminding niggas who\'s responsible for the classics. And I burn a hole in the street like a nigga was acid. While you getting yo\' ass kicked. Like a kick and a punch slap and two chops. pong ping baduf baf. beat him until he diggity 2Pac. Rope him and then drag him a few blocks. I\'m scuffling to eat. Like a nigga that was grinding and was hustling for weeks. Then I came through and I gave the streets crack. EVERYBODY PUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKING HANDS IN THE AIR!!!. I do the type of shit that niggas can\'t imagine (Uh Huh!). I make \'em all surrender \'til they see white flags. And they recognize I\'m the original dungeon dragon. RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon. Change your shitty drawers cause your pants are sagging. Try to step to this and I\'ll twist you to a turban.

I paint a portrait from my cell called life. inside the tortoise shell. Tortured. Orbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled. I smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters. Order one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter. Now is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram. Cuz I hobble with hollow hands. Please pan the nozzle. We see intent to re-invent dream application with homage to ancients. But honor modern replacements circling now basics. I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tipping the Petri dish (fresh). Beached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse. Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible. That's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical. I am not a crook. I cook the wick at both ends. Just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance. Life. Sight beyond. Fire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone. Belong to something civil, saint, cuz this Rembrandt paints on. And it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of Atlantis. Some present impressive lung, some truly learn what a death chant is. I alone personify mankind's collective sulk. As a result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk. Face it. Die. Place it on the shelf next to the portrait mommy gave you of the day it rained. But y'all posed by the slave ship anyway. Make it rain 'til the levy breaks. My fetus breeds as a combine of father time and his sweetest concubine, wine. And it saddens me like televised casualties. I'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes;. You don't want to miss it. As a token of my discontent regarding the equation. I'm officially closed for consultation.

S'that people outside of Occidental and European birth were in savage and cursed conditions,. and that God justified the captivity of these people, and the rape and pillage of their lands.. these oppressors would try to discard this same God, who supposedly justified this brutality,. in the name of Darwin, whose famous line ?survival of the fittest? was used to justify criminal behavior once the Bible could no longer be used as a hiding place for economic domination and evil intention.. Spirituality and morality were replaced by capitalism, and with it a conscious shift of focus toward the exploitation of the vulnerable. This approach would require people to examine the need/addiction to feel superior to someone else for no justifiable reason,. The Universe, will eventually seek to right/balance itself.. Of course there are white people who live transcendent lives, not exploiting ill-gotten privilege or perpetuating the sins of their ancestors who used violence and deceit as a means to gain advantage over others.. Black people remain in many ways a shattered community, disenfranchised, forcefully removed from context and still caged in, denied from making truly independent choices and experiencing existential freedom.. Taxation without proper representation, might I remind you, was the very platform of protest that began the Revolutionary War,. Anger is not only the natural response to the abuse of power, but is also appropriate when there is no real acknowledgment of these abuses, or deep, meaningful and profound change.. How then does the chief offender become the judge?. This same thing happens to people locked in communities where little light and little opportunity is allowed them, survival then forces them to twist and/or bend toward the only way of escape.. I shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term ?make the IRS whole?? make the IRS whole, knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities.. The entire time, I thought, who has made black people whole?!. Has America, or any of the nations of the world guilty of these atrocities, ever made black people or Africa whole or do they continue to sit on them, control them, manipulate them, cage them, rob them, brutalize them, subject them to rules that don?t apply to all?. When you are beaten or threatened with death for trying to read a book, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with education.. When looking at the oppressor is punishable by violence. When questioning or opposing oppression is punishable by death, imprisonment, or economic assassination, then opposing systemic wrong in any or all of its meta manifestations is a terrifying concept.. Much of my music, if not all of it, is about Love, a therapeutic resolve created in response to the lack of messages encouraging people like me toward free moral agency.. Helping to ameliorate this condition has never been addressed through the political arena alone.. we believe that people can be and should be helped,. and that trauma should not be criminalized but acknowledged, healed and dealt with. We have no desire to create humanoids, turn people into machines,. or dumb them down. so that they remain dependent longer than necessary to an antiquated system in denial of its many inadequacies and need to evolve. Instead we seek to educate and shed light on the snares, traps, and enticements that people set up in the name of business that are intended only to catch the sleeping and/or uninformed.. '

A righteous number of righteous men. Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end. They teach that we were the product of incest. Paganomics. Stand with us and don\'t look back upon it. Just face this mindstate. Otherwise Babylon. "Ninety-six gonna be that year".... [Verse 1: Andre 3000]. I bet you never heard of a playa with no game. Told the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame. Take this music dead serious while others entertain. I see they\'re making their paper so I guess I can\'t complain. Or can I? I feel they\'re disrespecting the whole thang. Them hooks like selling dope to black folks. And I choke when the food they serving ain\'t tasting right. My stomach can\'t digest it even when I bless it. I\'m confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight. Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose. We rolls through Headland and Delowe. Where me and my niggas would pass the flow. And got down for ours like hind catchers. My mind catches flashbacks to the black past. While mind close niggas laugh at. The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs. I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang. So go \'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen. Started by Afrika Bambaata. Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way. Like memories of yesterday. Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi. It\'s the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy. I\'m thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps. And throwing them craps. 7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back. For the robbing crew; thinking they\'re robbing you, you must be cautious. To staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless. Like Mortal Kombat,. but fucking these wombats got you dizzy. My nigga you know if I wanna be playin. But runnin up on me like you miss me. You catching the wrong vibe. As we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust. So keep that caine up out of your nose. Dearly beloved we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean. Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean. Oh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing. Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green. Light and we ain\'t gon\' stop until we hit the big screen. Psych, because no one is free when others are oppressed. So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest. Growing old. Like some eagles. people don\'t understand. Just like their parents don\'t be caring. I\'m speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing. In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches. Cause you fall in; falling like leaves into driveways. Isn\'t it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways. Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old. Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul. Growing old. See all them leaves must fall down, growing old. Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab. '

S'Giving me the eye as if I was the right antidote. So I decided to swing a smooth episode. While the train stopped at Grand Central turn. Before I knew her name I was massaging her perm. I said, "My you look drunk, have you been drinkin alcohol?". You got a fever here\'s an Extra Strength Tylenol. She said, "Great a comedian, comic". She leaned on me, I said, "Please don\'t vomit!". She said, "I\'m not I just need some rest". I said, "A few more stops, The Genius house is best". Got to my rest, her whole attitude change. But deep inside, she seemed sexually strange. Went in the room and she flopped on the bed. With wild-ass thoughts inside her headachish head. I went in the kitchen to prepare some food. When I came back in she was completely nude. I know it sounds weak but believe it or not. That the fever in her head ran straight to her twat. She was burning! Burning up out. It took more, than firemen, to put that out. And yo, I was hard, just as hard as a rock. That I can hit a home run, with my cock. She said, "Let me show you what we do uptown. I huff and I puff till I blow your balls down". Wild as a wolf from off Wilderness Ave. She said, "My what a great big ahhh! you have". I started dripping and dripping in consecutive terms. I know we must save water but that does not include sperm. Did you ever know a girlie who just loves to switch. From a Part Time Lover to a Part Time Bitch. While she\'s loving part time, she\'s riding on mine. She says, "I love you long as you keep making me feel fine!". In her behind, vagina, or heated climax. Cuz she can set records on oral sex. There\'s no lie what I said, she lives in the bed. If she got married, she\'d be a worn out newlywed. And if she heard these words yo she would not cry. Because sperm, the only damn tears in her eye. Her drip-drop face is the one I painted. Just stared in her eyes while she damn near fainted. As she choked, goggled, then spit up. Cuz cream, was flowing, all over her cup. On the bathroom floor cuz her parents were home. And I just could-n\'t tolerate her moans and groans. But there\'s one thing she could never erase. That the thing she really wanted just sprayed in her face. It used to be one, now it\'s five fingers of death. That rips her insides, as she gasp for breath. What she thought was love, turned out to be lust. That made her live by the laws, in sex we trust. '

S'In the past albums were made, put on the shelf. I was never paid or given a wealth. Who can I blame but myself? No one. I followed my azimuth then transit on a path from apprentice to master. My testimony any place at the top is lonely. Ask me what I cherish mostly, no matter what I say is poetry. The way I walk, the way I talk, the way I fought. The way I won, the way I lost, the way I thought. When they tried to play me out as a man. The way it felt takin\' showers in the sand with a fuel can. Wakin\' up in the middle of the night. I can\'t breathe right, I can feel my heart beat spike. Father Author, Poor Pauper use to be a war monger. I promised the Lord I will not tour any longer. Pardon the The Poor Pauper with nothin\' to offer from his coffer. Coughin\' up a mouthful of a volcanic sulfur. Since Channel Zero I tried to do somethin\' to save you. But you threw away the jewels I gave you. My words appear clear but true meanin\' is lost. Why would an emcee like that even talk?. Throw away everything you bought. And kneel before the Ark. YOU DON\'T! You knew you should but you won\'t. Any artist will become lethargic from weed smoke. I don\'t go to malls cause I don\'t like shoppin\'. I can\'t buy clothes when the mannequins are watchin\'. Overspecialization doesn\'t require special explanation. I\'m disinfatuated, you rappers are overrated. Civilization is fragile, so is life there in battle. Walk through the doors of Langley Headquarters. My logo is in the floor etched in marble. Behind the rose line, morals and dogma of rhymes. That climb one of three peaks of Mount Hermon there in my lifetime. The rhymes is 3 point 1 4 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9. Same morning that the Can-I-Bus album came out. I got a text from The NSA that. Said "They\'d take me out". Kabbalah Math was all I had. My wife and child. Were both killed in a helicopter crash. Eight months passed, I\'m in Walter Reed with a rare fungus rash. I tried to sit up but can\'t get up. This sucks, Father Author, Poor Pauper can\'t give up. The Biomarker lit up; the labtec took the blood that I spit up. She tried to screen it, than clean it. Hydroxide radicals I couldn\'t believe it. I was the Anemic Heathen that was saved by the blood of Jesus. My only grievance is I never be the same again. Never be able to rhyme like it was \'98 again. '

Make my (make my). Departure from the world. [Verse 2: Black Thought]. Tryin' to control the fits of panic. Unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic. Whatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics. When everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage. And my splaying got me praying like a mantis. I begin to vanish. Feel the pull of the blank canvas. I'm contemplating that special dedication. To whoever it concern, my letter of resignation. Fading back to black, my dark coronation.

And be a father to your child like the "Super!". He keep his hoes in check. Sends \'em out to get glows from off frozen necks. Tell \'em take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real. Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal. Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel. Make sure for extra wreck let him know how you feel.

S'Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me. Bending corners in the Benz. Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it. I know some hoes slutty. I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby. I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me. Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions. Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related. You don\'t grind, you be lying. Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe?. Lil\' Brotha. You see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots. 500 Benz. Konkrete. Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop. You say it\'s hot, well let me turn it up another notch. Fuck the cops. I chop you up like Norman Bates. The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque. Ludacris, yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot. Get the fuck on the ground. Is just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town. From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland. You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped. . Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below. I\'m with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios. Y\'all driving Subarus. stuck in your cubicles. I\'m stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles. Fourth and goal. Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll. Around and take the ball up the middle,the gut, the what, the hole. Cranium overload, overthrowed. Now we got seven more points on the board, fa sho. me oh my, I think He\'s blessing me. Like Ragu, it\'s in there. They say "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre". I say "people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay". We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions. Been spittin it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quittin?. Fuck, nigga. '

S"Send shots to your liver I deliver you death. You can barter your tomorrow but a martyr you?re left. Get you hot under the collar when my name?s on your breath. Click the starter on your Impala I?ll be there when you wreck. Fucking with me you better keep your feelings in check. Be the life of the party or a lifeless body. Get with me thinking you hard, you?ll be hardly standing. I?m the hardest of them all, you?re the hardest landing. Face first in the asphalt, your ass talked. Too reckless, now you helpless from the rounds you caught. I?ll teach your ass a lesson, outlined in chalk. Have you hostage in the hospice, high and trying to walk. I am bravery in a bottle, I am courage in a glass. I got the government?s approval, prohibition couldn?t last. I go hard. The whole family over for Christmas dinner. Let?s go through the purses and sell the gifts from your mom's house. They know you out here doing dirt for cash. Plus you the one unemployed, a couple dollars ain?t gon hurt they ass. I?m the only friend you got. You tried to sell me but you took a hit and eventually you just couldn?t stop. A couple of sniffs would get you lit but couldn?t get you to the top. Oh what an event when you got hip to cooking me into them rocks. I had you locked, you know it costs to come and see me. So fuck yo groceries, fuck yo bills, go on and pawn that TV. And fuck yo life, just catch this beam and take it straight to the dome. And fuck yo kids, the state?ll separate em? and place em? in homes. It?s gonna be cool, I know I got you crazy subdued. Ever since the 80?s played your whole community for a fool. And the ones that sold me smoke each other over new tennis shoes. They field niggas, I?m the definition of death, the real killa. I?m with the fiends on the block playing shoot em? up. When I erupt makes it hard to know who to trust. People scared to test me since the 80?s. Anybody can get it, man woman or baby. Shots do not discriminate, impossible to eliminate. I disseminate, you disintegrate. I can come off as a prick, you might get stuck with me. I?ll prolly steal your girl if you try and fuck with me. Cause next to me you?re looking quite frail. And if you snitch you?ll be counting your days in white cells. Just needlessly in CB4,. ask the CDC,. no CD4?s. Cause the truth is I?m on America?s dick. Uncle Sam fucks the poor and it?s making em? sick. Now their life?s in a tube, a downward spiral. Give a new meaning to going viral. I?m hard as they come. [Outro]. "

Still he?ll poke her with the wood and tell her be good. He could take a phrase like Peter Piper picked a pepper. I keep forgettin can?t go raw anymore. I keep forgettin rappers is impostas. Been a show stopper since a ho hoppa. To the naked face who wanna battle bring the neck brace. Violate, you might as well smoke me loc. Relocate Migrate or get caught with the okey doke. Watch that first step it's a doozy. Time flies as the hour glass trickles sand. before I blao this popsicle stand. A rolling stone and that's that at home. On the microphone like that's where he laid his hat at. I keep forgettin (keep makin dough). I keep forgettin (mad flow MF metalface ho's). I keep forgettin (actual stacks of shows).

S'I found your tape in my old collection. Put it in pushed play then I poured a fresh one. I look back with a hesitant laugh. But in reality it?s dark down memory ave. All the trials and suffering we shared with each other. A lot of people thought that we were actually brothers. You know me, you know I?m a control freak. Who told you, you could die before me?. Gone, another dog lost to the wild. I feel like a snot-nosed child. And when I hear your Smile. Its outlined in sadness. You poked holes in the magic. You taught jokes to the clowns. That never learned how. To appreciate the lights. Before the bulbs burned out. One little flicker of light. Can erase the dark. One little flicker of light. Can erase the dark. Yeah, I been thinking, You already know. Do I sound frustrated? Probably so. Sometimes I feel guilty, I was out on the road. If I?da seen where it was going I?da stopped the whole show. I realize it ain?t realistic. I keep tryna make the pieces fit with. The info presented. I felt resentment. I held this against myself. I wanna help my friend. It stays in my head. That I was on a stage when you were laying in bed. Body was discovered by your own mother. It penetrates my chest, I still taste the regret. That I slept through a late night call from your homie. But then I spoke with Siddiq the next morning. And then I smoked one million cigarettes. Go figure, maybe I was tryna catch up with ya. One little flicker of light. Can erase the dark. One little flicker of light. Can erase the dark. Yeah I been sinkin?, you already know. Do I look exhausted? Probably so. I don?t get much sleep. I?m not sick, I?m fine. I?m just tryna make the most of this limited time. And I?m missing you but I ain?t gonna lie. The distance grew between Eye and I. And at the end, even though we didn?t speak enough. You were easily one of the best people I?ve loved. Now I?m tryna write a song for a dead songwriter. That wrote they own songs about life and death. And every breath is full of self-awareness. Don?t ever be afraid to be embarrassed. So I wrote these words to describe what I cry about. But I?m certain if you were here right now. You?d ridicule these lyrics, you?d hate this chorus. You?d probably tell me that the concept is too straight forward. One little flicker of light. Can erase the dark. One little flicker of light. Can erase the dark. '

S'and liable. To get the gun buckin at 5-0, I\'m tribal. I\'m from a place where the *niggas* are jelly. And pretend to be your friend and put one your belly. And you can keep on yelling, the cops won\'t come. You want beef, we got burgers and. then some. We from the era when we learned on our own. Runnin wild in the streets with both parents at home. Kind of hard to find a young un alone - caused we was crewed up. Taggin on the walls taught wars and getting chewed up. Now I don\'t know about y\'all, but I\'m bout to make a small fortune. By taking small things and blowing em out of proportion. Using sarcasm as my second language. Look mom I\'m famous, I mean I\'m flagrant. You say you write your best rhymes when you high. I say I write my best rhymes cause I\'m fly. This is why I\'m cold, I\'m Minnesota nice. So please lil asshole, keep your mouth closed. \'Fore your momma be like "Look at my son, he out cold". You could tell I\'m focused by the look in my eye. You could see I\'m dirty by how clean my kicks is. And leave me and Slug here to play with these bitches. You know I spit the sickest sickness since syphilis. Mixed with malaria, fuck it, the more the merrier. B-Boy, D-Boy, yep I\'m in your area. To do this you need style, I thought you knew. It\'s not a diss, yo it\'s just my point of view. Spit phat, not anorexic shit. I hustle hard for the love of god. My life has been the biggest struggle for the bloody start. I knuckle up and throw the hands of my thug at heart. So when the shit hit the fan I don\'t come apart, I breathe and shrug it off. Atmosphere - the Big Brother\'s big brothers. Catch is here to turn king to wrist cutters. Just trust it ain\'t no regular shit. That\'s a polite asshole and a sensitive pimp. You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac. Dr. Dre Training Day rappers don\'t know how to act. Remove em all from my sight like a cataract. Poof! It\'s a magic act. Walk over beats like DMC, three stripes. Thievery be three strikes. visa need three swipes. Walk like a pimp. think like a Macintosh. Battle scars, yah\'ll still trying to figure out your avatars. Leave the cameras on, told ya partner that he can\'t perform. Yeah, yeah, I solemnly swear. To fight the good fight as long as I\'m here. But sometimes the good fight don\'t seem fair. Cause all the best soldiers we had ain\'t here. They gone now, we all on our own now. And most of those left ain\'t got no style. You give em an inch they try to take a whole mile. Too overconfident to keep a low profile. Pump your brakes, stay in your lane. Sit your 5 dollar ass down before I make change. Break these chips down, count your business. I treat Hip Hop like a sport. Stay on my game, put my time on the court. While you complain and get high some more. Might explain why your team can\'t find support. Now catch me in the back wit a whisky. Chattin up a missy like I\'m attractive and witty. I have to dip to do my raps and get busy. Why don\'t you come see me when I\'m back in your city?. '

I know who can put me back together, make me feel whole. So take me apart, try to break me down. Spend all you got just to hate. the clown. You can fake the frown, imitate the sound. It goes, one little, two little, three little indie rap. Headphones, backpacks watch em' all piggyback. Switch up my styles, they all complain. But see which kids next year sound the same as me?. The same shit yesterday was like today. Only difference is I trust even less of what you say. But all in all I still make the noise, I still break the toys, I still hate your voice.

But still say you're content, how the situation lay. Why you play? Why do you stay? There's something better. Know you felt it when you received my first poetic letter. Why you fronting? Tell me something. Is it that you want your cake and stuff it down your face too?. Did I have to chase you?. Why oh why do you cry?. Said afraid of losing me? I think that you're confusing me a lot. Was it that time of the month or were you going through a phase?. Complicated maze. (This phrase fits you perfect). Come back in later days. (Talk to me when you're certain). You're always changing. (Never stay the same person). Come back in later days. (Talk to me when you're certain). Now facing you is irritation. Know you used to have me placing you on pedestals like a goddess. Soon to depart us like red seas by Moses. Our friendship's diseased, unfeasible, hopeless. No reasonable answers to my question of focus, Caused my tension. Nothing made sense when you replied with a tied tongue. Said you feared abusiveness, I never swung. Why all these excuses miss? What have I done?. Figured I had the right kind of lady, yeah maybe it was fun, for you. But not for me,. I found it quite unamusing. You were using me as a bridge just to pass what was left behind. Play times for dangerous minds, but why'd it have to be mine?. Why'd it have to be mine?. Now I'm not really trying to come off abrasive. But why you messing with my man's head?. I mean I'm spending time trying to keep his mind on rhymes and beats. And you're a distraction.. you must mistake me for a fool. See I know how you are, I see those tricks in you. Come to and smell the coffee, go drink the pot with extra caffeine. Cause next to acting, you win awards for cloudy vision. See the colors of these areas have started turning gray. See you later, goodnight, got no more candles to light. Yo, it's time to move along cause baby something isn't right. Still I'm glad I met you, it's too bad you screwed it up.

B-E-A-S-T-I-E,. what up Mike D. Ah yeah, that's me. I got franks and pork and beans. Always bust the new routines. I get it - I got it, I know it's good. The rhymes I write - you wish you would. I'm never in training - my voice is not straining. People always biting and I'm sick of complaining. So I went into the locker room during classes. Went into your locker and I smashed your glasses. You're from Secaucus - I'm from Manhattan. You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'. There it is. Father to many - married to none. And in case you're unaware I carry a gun (word). Stepped into the party - the place was overpacked. Saw the kid that dissed my homey and shot him in the back. Man, I had to get a beeper cause my phone is tapped. You better keep your mouth shut cause I'm fully strapped. I got money in the bank - I can still get high. That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly. I've got money and juice - twin sisters in my bed. Their father had envy so I shot him in the head. If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page. The girlies I like are underage (check it). Girls with boyfriends are the kind I like. I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike. My father - he's jealous cause I'm making that green (what up?). October 31st - that is my date of birth. I got to the party, you know what I did? the Smurf. We ragtag girlies back at the hotel. And then we all switch places when I ring the bell. I chill at White Castle cause it's the best. But I'm fly at Fatburger when (when he's) I'm way out west. All the fly ladies, they're on my jammy. Went to the prom - wore the fly blue rental. Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental. I met a girl at the party and she started to flirt. I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt (check it). Spent some bank - I got a high powered jumbo. Rolled up a wooly (what did he do?) and I watched Columbo. Mmm... drop. Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer day. Just me, my posse and MCA. A lot of beer - a lot of girls - and a lot of cursing. Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger. On the checkin' at the party on the Forty Deuce. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.... Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.... Brooklyn, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.... "

S'Denizen of black earth, gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork. Buried by a 7 year cherub in the backyard. Epitaph and all. Disciple of the cycles and sciences, of birth into fertilized hyacinth. Life into vitamins, invited up to cypresses. A testament to moxie and the miracle of lifelessness. It\'s tricky when you\'d rather rot into the soil as a nutrient. Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig?. The nuances of putrefying jelly hit the levee. When those feathers are a cancer in your bestie. Memitim ascending, settling any high scores. 40 meters up with the heart of a high dive horse. Paint "No Rules" on the water tower. I told my ex in \'97 I was falling on my weapon. Ripped the phone up out the wall. An embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions. And the kind of doctors who use words like "cognitive" and "spectrum". While explaining why you\'re selfish to romanticize a ruse. In which unruly roots pull you to Lucifer by your shoes. I mean, it isn\'t perfect but don\'t misconstrue the purpose. Any urge is indiscernible from community service to the kiddo. Plus she\'d make a beautiful widow. But that\'s an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows. Hmm you\'d think he would\'ve learned back in the 80s. When they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety. But he didn\'t, it wasn\'t cause he doesn\'t get the message. More he doesn\'t judge a man by how honorable his death is. On a scale you made up anyway. Half past out to pasture. Whether clapped or batteries in backwards. I had a pet lizard, he never got an obit. Fed him crickets, it was dead a fucking month before I noticed. An older me would note that whether disposable goldfish. Or theist, we certainly become the earth as equals, in a circle. Unique until the spirit isn\'t willing. While the flesh is still a staple of the labor force and whistling. It\'s roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don\'t. That\'s a reality you evade or grow to own. Social code broke and a hierarchy to gasp at. Black labs over wack dads on the admat. Tabby over parasite, bats at the parish. A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms. I\'m born from the guts of stars and black tar pits. Iron Maiden denim paint the devil under grawlix. Crawls out a clawed coffin to huff and puff. Somewhere in between the dust and dust. '

Now Benny was a New York City graff kingpin. Five borough fame, guaranteed to itch pigskin. Raided near the Brooklyn Naval yard, juxed undercover. When they asked him what he pled he said, "You\'re fuckin\' up my colors!". Okay, Jose is working in the slaughterhouse. And he\'s living in the hood, but he wants to get his daughter out. Slipped off a ledge, and fell into a machine. Another dead immigrant, that\'s the American Dream. Miss Molly, helpless, made a penny with a data entry temp gig. Overqualified by the rent\'s thick. Red brick bash with a texted green screen. Like, "I entered my data right into your screen". Jane went insane, she\'s an anchorwoman. Sick of pushing skewed information. And abusing the nation. Had a few options:. Either jump or run. Critical ways or waving a gun. Time for C-H-A-N-G-E. Held a knife to the VP on TV. She demanded that the format be expanded. Beyond fair, everybody clear, understand it?. For the dope he stole cream. Banking off his old scheme. Billy watches Maggie from behind steel bars. Like "Where the crack went?". "I\'ma smoke it tomorrah". They call him Larry Luck. Blackjack, big spender. He was married once. Till he bet her ring finger. Seen leaving Las Vegas. With a pick up truck, diamond. Fourty large, and beautiful wife piece. Less than what he came with. Hitched to the crib found nickels in the couch. Hitched back to the casino with in an hour. Said "I\'m here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents". EMS. Said that he could be revived but they lied. Afterlife realized that water from the skies. Washes pain from our eyes so our hopes could rise. Bum touched girls looking young enough to thumb suck. Once sought a life thought it right to rat him out. Now gets raped by Aryans in the big house (OUCH!). Ted did 20 years for growing some weed. Although he used to snort coke and dabble with speed. Welcome home, homie, here\'s a blunt with hash. They said you know the rules bitch, take two and pass. Some cats grow by the laws of the wild. Some learn slower and lag in the mud. Some stand up in defense of a style. Some let the big dogs eat them up. I got one Jack or Jill. Jill won\'t, Jack will. Jill didn\'t, then did it. Jack fell. No cellophane secrets, b. Parted your partners veil and dipped. I\'m New York harbor. Tale of a sail, ripped sorta. Stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace. But would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday. Turns out I wasn\'t cast in the master plan anyway. He holds no grudge, holds his tongue, wow. Same one she used to hold in both smiles. Dagger the instinctual last shout if it killed me. So you can ride up in the sun city guilt-free. One year passed, the table is wobbling and your hollerin\' back. Sippin the fits you skip when shit cracks. They never missed it. Not a long haul, bullshit, kids kicked into the sink. Shoebox, with a flicks of lipstick. I\'ll love you forever, cuz you know me better. For the record, at one time, would have married you in a second. But kill the rekindling dreams, and navigate the friendship.

"Get real", they tell me. If only they knew how real this life really gets. They would stop acting like a silly bitch. They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it. Doesn\'t take much and that\'s messed up. Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us. While everyone was trying to out-do the last man. I was just a ghost trying to catch some Ms. Pac-man. Hello ma\'am, would you be interested. In some sexual positions and emotional investments. See, I\'m not insane, in fact I\'m kind of rational. When I be asking, "Yo where did all the passion go?". East coast, West coast, down South, Midwest. Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh. Somebody give me a big yes. God bless America, but she stole the B from Bless (and kept it). Now I\'m too fucked up to dance. So I\'mma sit with my hand down the front of my pants. So go pry open that trunk and get those amps. In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester. Treat me like a God, oh they treat me like a leper. You see me move back and forth between both. I\'m trying to find a balance. I\'m trying to build a balance. So now I keep a close eye on my pets. Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and scents. It\'s eat, sleep, fuck, and self-defense. So straight you can set your clocks and place bets. Wait, let\'s prey on the blind, deaf, dumb, dead. Hustle, maybe a couple will love what you said. Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land. With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hand. Yeah, I got some last words, fuck all of ya\'ll. Stop writing raps and go play volleyball. Gotta journey the world in a hurry. Cause my attorney didn\'t put enough girls on the jury. Guilty of dropping these bombs in the city. But I\'m innocent, love is the motive, that\'s why I\'m killing \'em. Guilty of setting my fire in all fifty. But I\'m innocent, blame it on my equilibrium. Now all my friends are famous. It\'s either one thing or another. They all don\'t know what my name is. Probably know both of my brothers. The one is a hard workin\' savior. The other\'s a hard workin\' soldier. I\'m just your next-door neighbor. Working hard at tryin\' to stay sober. You wait for the car at the corner. Pretend like you know what the plot is. Won\'t quit till I hit California. And make you my Golden State goddess. '

S'Before you knew the underground or independent existed. I watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick. After stepping to KCR lit and flexing my shit. No gun talk, no gimmicks, just rounds of raw-dogging. Dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering. A hardcore poetic informed without burglary. Potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me. Everytime I prescribe a new pill, revolution. Quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution. Arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks. "Bad Touch Example" that soon became bucks. Had everybody sprung wondering where I came from. Screaming out "Independent as fuck" with an insane tongue. With an indelible squad of design monsters. Innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters. So we scripted an album and signed to Rawkus. Selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit. Preposterous sonics taking the world hostage. Classic hip-hop bombage dirty with style progress. Now I\'ve come from the \'80s juvenile Brooklyn. Where cats was like: "Gimme that subway pass, kid. Good lookin.". Now someone else is taking a ride with what\'s mine. So I had to develop styles with a death device cooked in. So when I battled in basements I had eight sentences. Waiting way before the four you had laced in. Only faggots make shit up just to get famous. So when I finally blew up I remained sick. Earning respect in ghettos and \'burbs for word placement. Back when the independent scene remained faceless. We were the only crew who promised your ass we\'d take it. Mold it, shape it, living outside the matrix. Hold it, make it, more than miniature major labels. Hold it sacred, living it for the culture. Told ya plainly, protected it from the vultures. That\'s why I always get respect from true soldiers. While half of the critics claim it every year: "Hip hop\'s over.". FUCK YOU, hip hop just started. It\'s funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it. But true veterans\'ll give dap to those who started it. Then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit. New slang, new thought, new sound. Who\'s heart you thought you had?. You clown, you don\'t, you drown. I won\'t dumb it down. I\'m a live mothefucker plus I\'m gunning for clowns. So you can break out of that invisible box, you\'re not down. My favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about. Comic books, spaceships, and Obi-Quan one. And even though they were soft they had fun. But they couldn\'t break out the frame of the town they came from. I\'m keeping their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels. But since they had no identity from the start. They started to resent the scene when they couldn\'t become a part. I\'ll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerd rap. Making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard. Patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit. I\'ve been putting out vinyl since \'93 and never looked back once. You don\'t innovate because you can\'t innovate. It\'s not a choice despite what you might tell your boys. Keep your identity crisis under the table. I always knew who I was and I\'ll always be more famous. For the best in the vendor biz. 1-800-Lazerface. Leave the last "C.E." off for Craps and buy them Haterade. The revolution will not be apologized for. Fraggle rock your four figure watch. I clock ninety-nine cent wristbands. And still know the time when you record flops. Exhibit A. E. S., Genesis of the klepto reactor. Wanna burgle the buzz over definitive cash. After a life of labor camps starts paying innovaters back. Stop running bases with little bears under the wing of punchdrunk Buttermakers. Wrong name by a molar can often expose your phobias. Watch a cobra grow hands to hold his own tongue when he notices. Wide open with banged out cutlery from a slang mouth teacher. And money is an ugly god we all fall for. I got land mammal, cannibal, natural evolving squackbox. That means when I wake up and decide to comprise the new shit. It\'s not some watered down version of what my favorite crews did. Puff the magic komodo bitch. Look, I\'m done. B-boy, feed that to the needy. '

Losing his coat. Schmoozing a high and head-rush. Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some. One eye on the breadcrumbs. Other eye on the Drencrom. Other other eye on the income. Good knife and a grin. Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms. Peg leg, smells like Medellin wake in the night. Make a pipe out of anything. Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane. Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8. Back out, black out somewhere fancy. Shaped like the backseat of Aesop\'s Camry. Dude... seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt. In the end, if you give an address in a river of piss.

In terry cloth robes outside detox surly. Curse at a beat cop, doctor a Slurpee. Adopt no Xerxes, fear no moon man. Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants. Oooh, never could avoid himself. For long enough to contain or employ as help. And now he look both ways at the asteroid belt. Buzzed, gross and wholly unloved. Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "kiss the ring". From a fortune to Fisher King. Or from assisted care, blisters in his hair. No shoes, no shirt, no fiscal year. I said hello to Marshall every morn for 6. He yelled at me every time, that\'s amore, bitch. It only took one tooth to crack the bug juice and chug. Outside home is an open swim. I stepped over a body in the door. I pretend he asleep but it\'s probably more, God damn. Profound apathy, heart with a crack. I\'m ships in the night. I\'m darts at a map. '

Like your home got invaded by the feds. Sing a song we will recite. Worked so long to build your life. But it could feel so wrong to feel alright. Sing a song we will recite. Worked so long to build your life. But it could feel so wrong to feel alright. Apocalyptic, little predictable. Hold your breath in, and then dive in the decadence. I'm lucky I'm alive just to represent. And document my life in the present tense. So I'ma keep talking shit. Until mama nature kicks us off the tit. Sing a song we will recite. Worked so long to build your life. But it could feel so wrong to feel alright. Sing a song we will recite. Worked so long to build your life. But it could feel so wrong to feel alright. "

S'Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips. And make you rappers have fits cause I\'m back in the mix. Fuck a pad and a pen, write rhymes on a IBM. Ebonics is dead, the binary language is in. Canibus practices in a room with a thousand candles lit. Meditating on this rap shit. My left hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven chakras. So keep standing on the corner. The trash man will collect you in the morning. Thug cats fronting, wacker than Blinky Blink. On the back of the Raptor Wagon babbling about nothing. Fuck that, real Rugrats can get it on black. Be ready and at your best, the Celebrity Match of Death. Heart snatched through your chest, cardiac arrest. Crack your neck while I break your arms, catch your breath. Then I asked the ref, "How many cats is left?". All I have is a pen and punishing kids. Every word I say detach a vertebrae from your spine. snot-box. Push your forehead to the back of your mind. Try to explain, what it\'s like seeing your brain. You\'re insane, whose gonna ID the remains?. And then I reincarnate \'em, and kill \'em again. Again and again, again and again, c\'mon. The nigga had long hair so I grabbed a handful. And chopped him in the Adam\'s apple. His partner in back of you tried to attack you. So I\'ma twist \'em up like a pretzel then I\'ma tag you. I\'m on some Stone Cold shit, warn your whole clique. Who want to spit, bang \'em quick, strangle \'em wit his lip. Try to flip, leave his body dangling by his hip. I can\'t believe he tryna grapple again. 6 subtracted from 10. Seven birds. swerve. till their vision is blurred. And stick my dick in your ear and fuck what you heard. '

S'I used to cop a lot but never copped no drop. Hold mics like pony tails tied in bobbalobs. Stop and stick around. come through and dig the sound. Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around. Bound to go three-plat,. came to destroy rap. It\'s a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped. Femstat cats get kidnapped. Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that. Metal Fist. terrorists claim responsibility. Broken household name usually said in hostility. Um... what is MF? You silly. I\'d like to take "Means to the End" for two milli\'. "Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That\'s a audio daily double. Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo. Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black. Stay in the zone - turn H2O to Cognac. On Doomsday!. ever since the womb ?til I\'m back where my brother went. that\'s what my tomb will say. Right above my government, Dumile. Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who\'s to say?. I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section. If you don\'t believe me, go get bagged and check then. Cell number 17, up under the top bunk. I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk. Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped. God forbid, if there ain\'t no escape, blame MF tape. Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children. One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building. While Sidney Sheldon. teaches the trife to be trifer. I\'m trading science fiction with my man the live lifer. A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime. Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime. Get out my face, askin\' ?bout my case, need toothpaste. Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent. And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness. Real mens mind their own business. That\'s the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that\'s double-dutch. How come I hold the microphone double-clutch. C.O.\'s make rounds, never have ?ox found. On shakedown, lock-down,. wet dreams of Fox\' Brown. On Doomsday!. Ever since the womb ?til I\'m back where my brother went. That\'s what my tomb will say. Right above my government, Dumile. Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who\'s to say?. Doomsday. Ever since the womb ?til I\'m back to the essence. Read it off the tomb. Either engraved or unmarked grave, who\'s to say?. Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say". Some M-er F-ers don\'t like how Sally walk. I\'ll tell y\'all fools it\'s hella cool how ladies from Cali talk. Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang. Nicknames of nimble and tip of nipple. metal fang. Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang. Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans. Only gin and Tang. Guzzled out a rusty tin can. me and this mic is like yin and yang. Clang!. Crime don\'t pay, listen, youth. It\'s like me holding up the line at the kissing booth. I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth. Spittin\' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth. But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce. So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife. Strong enough to please a wife. Able to drop today\'s math in the 48 keys of life. Cut the crap far as rap. Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing. What the Devil? He\'s on another level. It\'s a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!. [Outro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl]. When I was led to you. I knew you were the one for me. I swear the whole world could feel you MC. '

S'Story over no more. Hopin to prevent it but. "You make me wanna live". She said that with a straight face. And she placed keep sakes. Inside her suitcase. "Everything you say is a lie". He said that with a smirk. Fully aware that it\'ll hurt. When it hits the nerve. "You\'ve never heard a word I\'ve said". She responded. But he heard that. And remembered it forever like a promise. Now here we are, wearing hatred on our masks. Let\'s carry on, put all your eggs inside that basket. Swing it round, until that wooden handle snaps. Sort \'em all out and only keep the ones that cracked. "You make me wanna die". . That\'s why I trust you. That\'s so I can look you in the eye and say I love you. I\'ve never seen a sun decide to set so abrupt. As it does when the gun inside of you wakes up. Almost as if it\'s trying to hide from your tantrums. Head full of hurt, pride,. a closet full of phantoms. Never seen the sun shine quite so loud. As it does when that little girl makes herself proud. Almost as if it wants to come play a part. In those moments when your heart ain\'t afraid of the dark. But sometimes I swear you make the sun confused. It wants to rise but it over-analyzes what to do. It cries more than you, when the storms come knockin. Tries to hide it\'s face, just avoid watchin. I would drive by and wave, but there ain\'t no parade. So I\'mma stay and wait for the day the sun goes away. Set us free. I want to live. I want to die. What is it about women that brings out my venom. Thought it was a peach, it tasted like a lemon. I ate it anyway, can\'t help it\'s my natural. From one extreme to another, no room for practica. Just act casual maybe they won\'t notice. Or fall off the planet so you can escape the focus. Break the dirt; bury me down when I\'m broken. Or let the under-current carry me out to the ocean. Can\'t swim as good as I could as a child. But as a kid, I never swam just stood there and smiled. Even though the idea of drownin in you. Seems kinda like it might be the wrong thing to do. You gotta take a look at you and I, the clown and the fool. Love can make suicide sound so cool. Set us free. Dying must be, dying must be, dying must be heaven. Cus living is hell. Let\'s watch the sun disappear into the water. Let\'s watch these people, and point at the imposters. Let\'s lay it on the line, let\'s travel across it. Let\'s live forever no matter what it costs us. Claustrophobic,. lots of down talk. Toss clothes in and turn it off. Easily lost in moments. Forgot the motives,. sun almost exploded. Lookin for proof. who would\'ve knew, toy gun was loaded. Go ahead and throw it out into the waves. Say goodbye to yesterday and try to fly the stress away. Took it from the sky and looked it straight into the eye. Silence,. trying to read between the snore and the sigh. There\'s a reason that they say that they can\'t take it with \'em. If you\'re leavin cuz of love, it really isn\'t livin. I want to live I want to. Die motherfucker die. '

S'They sue for Cash Rule but the courts they give \'em nothing. Your soundman came with the feedback like we need that. Security\'s shining flashlights like "where the weed at?". Of keeping MC\'s in a hopeless situation. No comparison, if you put the darts side by side. One will weigh out the other. Like friend next to brother. Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion. That structure that supported your rap started implosion. Raindrops keep falling on your head. So heavy that it\'s tearing what you\'re wearing. Or a snare with no kick. So you know it be authentic like the hand-made works of a carpenter. The 64 squares make \'em use a sharpener. Kept a fine point with the lead. On the paper then like cancer it would rapidly spread. This music is addictive but can\'t live without it. I couldn\'t be more wrong if I changed the format. Did something different from the most explored rap. Positive Elevation Always Correct Errors. My songs set a trap. Not to play it is a terrible loss at whose cost?. People wait like never before for the ball to drop. Wrote a essay off the second LP to prove a point. That a rhyme is a terrible thing to waste. Gimmicks and radio the God don\'t chase. But I replace your wackness, it shows in your flows. Immaturenesses, all of your hoes, case closed. Most of your strength is in the pocket of you clothes. That you endorse in every rhyme like it\'s garments and robes (echo). '

Not a bother, not a lot to say. That is until you ask about the one that got aw-w-w-way. Like a tall tale, keep it rod and reel. With his arms stretched out to define the kill. While the village always listened, believin' it was different. Out of eight million stories there was not a single witness. It was always at the last second when the line snapped. Or the boat broke in half from the size of the catch. Either way the documented proof didn't exist. So the locals dismissed the big f-f-f-fish. Billy-goat beard twenty years in the making. Carried lures in his brim, carried beer in his waders. Stinked like alcohol of all prominent flavors. Carried knives in his vest, carried war in his nature. Sat among the forest floor critters and pine cones. Could tie a perfect fly with his eyes closed. Veteran angler with a mission to run. Make all naysayers hold t-t-t-tongues. Pale blue moon or fiery orange glow. Red sky at dawn or rain, hail, sleet, snow. Black storm cloud with the barometric horrors. The weatherproof sportsman spins yards regardless. Laugh if you wanna, but the dude ain't stupid. Let it roll off his back like drizzle off plumage. Cause he walk with a twinkle in his eye. And every dog has his day and today is m-m-m-mine. "

Breaking too much mind trying to unravel the babble. That dismantled and left the lines in need of some assembly. So I can find the secret key and free all the emcees. This planet spins on a thin axis. All-access passes won't help you to grasp the Atmos. I mean, what did you think. My agenda was to freestyle, smile, get paid to smoke weed. And grab the mic and spoonfeed?. There's more to this than just paying the rent. If you're riding on this song you need to ride it to the end. What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?. Planets as small as balls of clay. Some shells get broke. Some keep their wigs closed. Some get exposed as little man big pose. Some make moves and some stay daydreamers. But everbody seems to want some loot, food and a beemer. Well make mine hunter green with camel insides. 10 percent tints, Mr. Pibb, and some french fries. Inch by inch I take it closer to the shoulder. But day by day it's getting harder to stay sober. Once again on the edge, head's inebriated. Movement needs motive, it's easier to be sedated. Why does my psyche give a damn about whether or not you like me?. I grip this mic tight because it's all I really have a grip on. So let the losers lose and let the players play. The only difference is the day to some dust on the clay, what. [Hook]. Whose world is that? it ain't mine, and I'm grateful. Already got a plate full of clay on my table. I'm capable of handling fate, I know this. Too many get caught up in the lines that emcees thought up. But it's clear to me the ones that fear me are the ones that oughta. I spot a blemish on your planet's existence. I deliver subtle terror submerged in clever sentences. The only residue that came of the hypothetical spew they sprayed. My man Beyond knows. There's more than sand and fluid. Involved in how I revolve and evolve. I can't bring it with so I'm a leave me here. Centuries from now they're gonna study Atmosphere. Carefully I steer, I'm aware life is fatal. When I go, I wanna go like Hov, taken by the play-dough. [Hook]. "

S"You know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin. And everything you had is gone in the split of a second. Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit. Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin fun of them niggas. I give thanks cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggas. Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile. Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while. Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child. Continue frontin, like it's nothin while you live in denial. You overexert the little you have left to save face. You tryin to hide your expression from lookin worried. On what to do when your career is buried. You ain't whippin the Range, you ain't whippin a Rolls no more. You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob. Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away. Forgettin you a man first, chasin the fame. Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin your name proper. "

S'The game is not only dangerous, but it\'s most strange. I sell rhymes like dimes. The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times. Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick. Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick. A lot of \'em sound like they in a talent show. So I give \'em something to remember like the Alamo. Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game. Came back from five years laying and stayed the same. I\'m saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic,Spock. And G-Shocks her biological clock. When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, . thought I killed her goose. Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice. Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him. Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him. Never seen the shit again but he\'s still my dunny. The only thing that come between us is krill and money. I sell rhymes like dimes. The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broke times. Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not. If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along. Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks. Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks. Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe. To get the dough,. battle for bottles of Mo\' or \'dro. This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks. "Oh, you\'re too kind!" "Really? Thanks!". To the gone and lost forever like "Oh My Darling Clementine". He hold his heart when he telling rhyme. When it\'s his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven. He nasty like the old time Old No. 7. You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola. Make \'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola. I told her - no credit for a bag. If you want what they got, then go get it, it\'s all gak. Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck. And still keep your attitude on self-destruct. [Outro: Cucumber Slice]. Check it out, y\'all! Ya don\'t stop! Keep on, to the sure shot!. Huh-ha! Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh!. Land-O-Lakes. Rock-shocking the house, with another nugget. Fondle \'Em Recordings, 1999. Mashed potatoes!. Apple sauce!. Buttery... biscuits!. A yes, yes, yes, yes y\'all. You don\'t stop. Keep on, a\' to the break-a-dawn. You thought the song was over!. Ah! We tricked you!

My terms the memoir, obligation the bookmark. Crystallize impurities to zero on the.... Autocrat derby catapult sponges, my hunches hurling murder abundance. Lunches where the city sump is pungent, (Curdling!). Tomorrow sits on what the sin/consquence merger brings. To bubble up along the edges of precious child fantasy broken, broken. Hi, my name is Hazardous Tobacconist. hung on the brink. I purge a dirge and spit my lung in the sink. As for the product, well it\'s wrenched in a barren backward wasteland. Of shimmering moral tension. adventuring to blossom pleasant. I\'ve done it all, from pixie dust to cramming pins in voodoo dolls. And ninety-nine dreams linked on the shooting gallery wall. But it\'s like, not a wave crash similar to last or next. Heckle me not already doctored by regrets. Rain (rain). Belligerent fragments bond massive. Usher in the pixels \'til the image burn classic. Bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket. Imma cast it out to sea and wait for my karma to grasp it. I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches. And I know the rat race of the bad taste once its grimace cringes. See, an iron butterfly will float if given good condition. But I\'m still fishing the same worm from the same faulty position. (Prosperity). Sorta makes you think. m a Tomahawk I walk alone and mis. Inside the accidental meeting of the pencil and the seedling. And the central started beating. Breathing at a rapid caliber. I doubt if her allotted grace will last forever more. Dusting off a dream to be an autopilot. Still a silent understudy.. Funny how the opposite will throttle. And the different stroke and model to the prison. Is an accurate portrayal of inadequate betrayal of a wish. Gonna-wanna-coulda-shoulda-woulda didn\'t. Isn\'t it amusing choosing. Yet a plan is hibernating. Waiting till the mating means of motivation took a fine position. Dishing only after every little kiddy has performed. I just wanna be a general he said.

Gallop my chariot burning and awful enigma. Sprung by the sling of David. to pierce gutter bug batch prior to hatch. Dismiss it as a soul cadets\'. excuse to decorate maps with thumb tacks. This gold star product pushing hate boogie themes. Enter the smoke screen. Blazing saddle remnants alive analyze pensive. Connect all picket fences like chain gangs linked digging trenches. To candy land image factory. Sold. Oh, I wanna be an astronaut, I got the merits and heart. And I bought a starship with hard earned money from one hour selling dreams to dummies. When they raised the lights:. Ja-ja-Jesus Christ! I\'ve never seen so many goblins in my life! (Oh, my lord). Migrate through the fog and then some. Dragging bitch circuits on a short leash like organ grinder primates dancing for bread crumbs. Well, did you touch that slugger?. Banging on the table with an old tin cup, thin luck. I can raise the dead while the shocked settlers fled the blaze. Sprung out their bed of nails to spread the sails, racing for milk and bread. But I got (big) big plans. I ride a big boat with a big ol\' motor. And I ain\'t really that big on helping you turn your leaf over. Bring out your dead, I got a pile sky high. Run if you\'re miserable, saw the planet fly by. My name is "Try to deny the magnificent doom craft my ragged soul built. And I\'mma show you why this fucking globe tilts". Take me where the air is clear. I don\'t really know where but I know its not here and. Every little step she takes makes me spin. Cause I know I\'ll never have to ever sleep alone again. '

Leonardo and Donatello, they both know we can do this. \'So kiggedty crazy Drayze hit them both with raw sewage\'. Now Rafeal and Michaelangelo, those two others who are brothers. Brooks smacked \'em with the Das EFX logo, the manhole cover. I could see general Buckshot goin toe to toe with Duke. Catchin wreck like Steele and Tek going up against the Crimson Gaurd. O.G.C. and Ruck the Irrational. \'The military punisher Big Rock just broke Roadblock\'s back!\'. We\'ve got Weapon X from Canada, a.k.a. Wolverine. But here comes the Method Man, a.k.a. Johnny Blaze!. Wolverine you can\'t hang, when Tical does his thang. Paralize you with the venom from the Method Man\'s fang!. We got Nasir Jones versus Peter Parker. halftime.

Listening to the road, voice of the nomad. How he'd love to leave drive away never go back. Wheels keep on turning, turning turning and turning. Alone is when he finally feels like a person. Nat Sherman. Crack the window, feel the wind blow. Serenity tenfold. God bless whoever invented sunglasses. And while your at save the saints that work the fast food drive-thrus. Objects are closer than they appear. Cause when your by yourself there ain't one else to lie to. Talk radio gets a lot of play in his vehicle. It teaches him topics to discuss with real people.

So Rich got his niggas out pitching on the curbs. While his cousin with the law, jaw singing like the birds. Said if he take the stand they plan to send him to the burb. So he pitched Rich to the Dixon, sent them to the birds. Cased him, replaced his bracelet with cuffs and chains. Leaving his sisters and his mother with nothing but more problems. "

S"Wild and out, man, it was crazy. Running around Hennepin. Waving a gun at frat boys and shit. Hey dog, I heard you got those trees. Wait dog, you can't possibly be. Even thirteen, what you doing open this late?. You ain't got no older brothers to hold you in place?. Yeah I know, you gotta get your hustle on. And life does go on and fronts like nothing's wrong. State law says you're too young to work. But a couple of bucks will put a gun up under your shirt. Coke, weed, junk and speed. Teach me another type of hide and seek. Chemistry, economics, math and business. Already a pimp before high school's finished. Even the rich kids get in the mix. Only difference is them bitches did it for kicks. And we quick to say it's just a game that's dealt. So big kid, where did you go?. We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes. Do it up so.... The movies and the music taught me how to do it. And how to build a crew, and how to get it moving. Supply and demand came and held my hand. Only had a pistol cause they had a pistol. Cocked that hammer and blowed them missiles. I only had a handful of minutes. So if we gon' talk then we only talk business. Because y'all don't be where those junkies be. But hold up now, you gon' pull your guns on me?. Nah man, I'm a big kid with big dreams. You gon' treat me like you know that I'm only sixteen. Huh, well fuck it right? Shut my eyesight. Only squeezed out a couple and I only got double life. Hey there girly, you got your worm early. Jumped off the branch, fly little birdy. Look around, but don't look down. Cause you see no need to touch foot to the ground. Sex, drugs, rock and rolled up. Them older boys got you thinking that you growed up. Spent the whole day getting high. Putting work on them little thighs. And I ain't tryna criticise. You gotta live your life, you gotta get your stripes. "

But leave your name and your number. And I\'ll get back to you. Once again it\'s another rap bandit. Fiending at I and I can\'t stand it. Wanna be down with the Day-Glo. Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo". Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo". "I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo". I can\'t understand what the problem is. I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz. How\'d they get my name and number. Then I stop to think and wonder. Bout a plan, yo man I gotta step out town. You wanna call me up? Take my number down. It\'s 222-2222. I gotta answering machine that can talk to you. Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter\'s the new. But nothing\'s new \'bout being hawked by a crew. Or should I say flock cause around every block. There\'s Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm. But it\'s not the mood to hear. The tales of limousines and pails. Of money they\'ll make like a pro. But the songs created in they shacks. Are so wick-wick-wack,. And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask. "was it def?". And with the straighest face I be like, "hell yes.". I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul. So I don\'t go AWOL but yet I know when they call they get. Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave. Haven\'t been to the jam in quite a while. Figure I\'ll catch up on the latest styles. \'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles. All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild. But edition up here by the miles to the center. Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in. And I be like, "Yo G, Pos does all the producing". Now woe is me to the third degree. Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny, jettin\'. Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky. Me, Myself, and I go through this act daily. But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour. Say, I would love if you\'d sing. The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak. '

So now you with the strapped niggas that want problems. No problem,. and the hood ain't changed in years. And I'm optimistic at times for politics can't erase the fear. Pro-black is dead, self-loathing and shit. Whole race feel misplaced since the Reagan Era. Hear cries from black moms for convisary. And the cops'll stop now, the town is different. See the blocks like black mamba, brown omitted. Little gentrification which ain't gender-specific. a few of niggas is bitches. Obama got a longer tenure. Yeah, one nation under God. Politics about the guap, I hate to break your heart. Could be a race war, niggas on your mark. 'Til somebody start. Conspiracy theorists in my lyrics. And feel like my shit is somehow different albeit. It could be the image of my niggas. And your perception is ruining my vision, dig that. My president mulatto,. A penny for your thoughts, my retorts worth a dollar. Get off my fucking George Carver. As far as little Bush, I'm thinking more little Rallo. Do you follow or did I lose you?. Ms. Dash, yeah, she bad, but the broad still clueless. Reese get her, not little. Witherspoon feeder 'til the seats fill up, get me. Paranormans on my feet nigga, jiggy.

And this is the only place where shorties can go to the beach and grow double D's. Like GOOD JESUS. Let me rub some lotion on your cleavage. Cause where we live summertime lasts about four seasons. Parties are real loud.. Car systems got clear sounds. Birds fly here in winter.. Chickens are here year round. And they ass is meaner, the grass is greener and tap is cleaner. So come on down, show and tell with some southern belles. Tricks with treats you don't keep in a pumpkin pail. Hospitality? we treat our company well. From Kentucky bales of hay way down to Florida shales. Gals with chunky tails, lookin' like something swell. You try and visit actin' ignant and startin' hell. Your trip'll last about as long as the XFL. Here, the weather's hot. Mardi gras in every spot like we live in a land without some clocks. From them Virginia docks, to Mississippi crops. Swing through Atlanta where them switches be liftin' shocks. So please leave all trash in the Herbie-Curby. Welcome to the dirty dirty. The southern south-paw. but everything is all-right. But in the dirty south everything ain't all peaceful. We still got racist people with inflated egos. Got foul cops shootin at niggas like we some free throws. Rough nights, bug bites from Jumanji mosquitoes. But still the home of black eyed peas, collard greens, that soul food. The home of southernplayalistic pimps lettin they hoes loose. The home of that bluegrass,. Cadillac grills, battle rap skills. The home of Miami Bass, 808's, and spring breaks. The home of gold fronts, home grown skunk, the home of sippin shine.

S"And watch the horizon blossom to cop a feel. Over the edge of the world. The one they're all afraid to walk. The rationate for why they're so high on the small talk. But Brian knows where the crows all go. To find the if's, and the and's and the but's and also's. If I could run through the woods, and speed like the light. I?d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight. If I could fly through the fog and look at this rock. I?d figure out how to keep Hell off of my block. But as it stands, I stay content. Tryin? to be the magic man, and pay my rent. Wishing that Brian would turn me on to the secrets he sought. While we keep burning the dawn, just to keep the day hot. If I could ask you one question, I?d ask where you went. You could teach me a lesson every time I got bent. But the alcohol don?t make me forget about it all. Doesn?t matter the season the leaves can still fall. They slipped hidden messages within the cards that were dealt. Trying to understand myself and all of the sorrow I felt. For as simple as I am how'd it get so complex. Got me studying the margins and disregarding the text. I open the curtains and listen to the traffic go. But I still get nervous each time my piece passes go. The residue is thick and the memory fails. I still laugh cuz the path feels a lot like a trail. If I could run through the woods, and speed like the light. I?d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight. If I could fly through the fog and look at this rock. I?d figure out how to keep Hell off of my block. But as it stands, I stay content. Tryin? to be the magic man, and pay my rent. Wishing that Brian would turn me on to the secrets he sought. While we keep burning the dawn, just to keep the day hot. We used to be a couple of pimps walking the hallways with pride. Drunk or sober, life was nothing short of rollercoaster rides. Trip to the clubs, nod the skull to the rhythm. All we wanted out of life was what was given. And when you passed I wanted to take back the time we wasted. I'd trade all the buzzes in for one more conversation. We can sit in the shade and discuss the meaning of sacred. Cause I can't see the garden no more, just the aphids. But the wind still blows and the plains still grow. And I wish your name was on the guest list at my shows. I got to believe that you can see me when I find my freedom. Cause you got to meet the sun before you got to meet my son. And when I see lightning, feels like my buzz is heightening. Everytime I feel the sun, I can smell the love. And when I smell the air I can hear a child trying. But everytime I hear a river I think the mother is crying. "

These niggas out of line, I heard they playin' for keeps. Well, I'm a self-made nigga, a well-paid nigga. So if a nigga need advice, well, he can listen to me. I seen a nigga play the weapon, leave a nigga deceased. Throwing nickels at the well but only changin' my jeans. I ain't changin' a thing, maybe I'm part of the problem. I done started a couple of parties where bodies were shot up. I done dissed some bitches, I done carried some friends. Shit, I've been in my feelings. I get over shit quick, understandin' my flaws. Loyalty is a law, MMG under God. One day, just one day they gon' understand this worn out heart of mine. And subscribe to this genuine article of mine.. But never mind, a brother you argue with is a brother you love enough to correct. The passion over profession as I religiously rep that MM shit.. I pray for the poor,. I pray for the rich. We gon' pray for these mentalities that only contingent upon our salaries, chains and chicks. Shit, I'm a pray for my enemies and I'm a pray for my squad. We gon' pray for Gaza twice as hard.

S'I wrote the book that shook America to splinters. In a winter wasteland icicle-bound barren township. Call Baron M?nchhausen and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig. Delinquent sinking like a paper tugboat. well beneath your holidays. Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty. I\'m a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag. It\'s like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels. To the Riverside Park Tunnel people claim last lifeform standing. Carbon based pardons ain\'t enough. My stilts truly personify this urbanite flea circus. We urchins merkin on daily. I catapult brain opera past basic. Tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it\'s ill. Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimmace. If you had one more eye, you\'d be a Cyclops. Which explains missing the premise. Bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh, die. Kiss the finish. piss the villagers the fuck off. Pete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes. Aes Rock might\'ve smoked one too many dimes in his time. Now, where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother?. Probably gathering your sheep with all these other motherfuckers. Struck twice in the same place by a moody Zeus fishliner. Smackin the third clear out the park. Going gone (To infinity and beyond!). I rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers. Hermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators. Keep your Honalee dreams out your homily. I deal with tangible goods. And avoid manufacturing food for landfills. I\'ve seen friends bow to needles. I\'ve seen needles bow to records. I\'ve seen boughs break. I\'ve seen the proud break. I\'ve seen alot for a blind soldier. Who tattooed a cityscape on skin to blend in. I\'m here to pull the three-prong on this prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice. Add a hatchet slice for kicks. And so that God-awful Frankenstein scar on your style can someday be a story for my kids. Life\'s hard, life\'s easy. Life\'s everyting in between. Life\'s Peachy like James and the Giant. And I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it. And I keep casting my line as long as these fish will bite it. And I like it. [Movie sample]. "Yes the bough is low. That\'s the way it goes though..... Maybe I should just give up or stop trying. But life is so uncertain, so short. I\'ve got to keep on searching. And wherever it takes me, I\'ve got to go". Bantamweight temper tantrum, decrepit anthem. Set a low goal, I arrive late. I\'m here to scrape a cog clean till the funk machine. Imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother. (Oh you got heart?). I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates. Like these here drunken little archers miss more than they calculate. The falcon hates the mockingbird. The farmer hates the drought. I hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting "Yes y\'all". And blow the village out perspective (Aesop!). Do you take this makeshift Candy Land cult-classic bastard style. To be your lawfully wedded head trip. To embrace throughout sickness, health, electrical storm. Fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!). I\'m balanced, personified phantom to the bone. Walkin like a Jabberwocky. Scalpin a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing. It?s just like Christmas with a shallow stocking. Like this (I\'m just trying to milk the mileage). You drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him. Soundin\' off like senior citizens sitting at Bingo parlor bickering. Yeah, it\'s kinda funny, isn\'t it?. How I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus. Dwarfed by the lights, bewildered by the fanbase. Bound by an idea, skeptical of the handshakes. Skeptical of the handshakes. '

S'Like those in this heart pounding tale of random horror. Of a body count, after trashin\' it, they done with it. Victims inflicted with passionate punishment. Specific offers of horrific torture. That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers. His ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down. Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town. Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked. Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks. As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney. So his childhood passion became a life long journey. Grew into a world of destruction, abduction. Left many body parts flowin\' on the Hudson. Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched. Screams was high pitched from scars you can\'t stitch. Mutilated and decapitated, white collar chicks. Just from his involvement in local politics. His outfit stained with the blood of the slain. While his backyard full of skeletal remains. His goal in life, was preparation for death. An autopsy showed asphyxiation, loss of breath. Was it his fascination, for strangulation. The lynchings in the \'20\'s was his inspiration. Unspeakable acts that made front page. Motivated by an unexplainable rage. "A suspected killer plaguing this community. Has once again eluded police and detectives". "We have no leads, no photos, no suspects". "This nameless, faceless murderer. Has killed a couple, execution style, in their own home. Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat". "We have no leads, no photos, no suspects". The State psychologist, forensic pathologist. Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious. They ruled out the possibility that the killa be. Physically fit with athletic ability. Talley and murder, on his agenda. There was no word, and it\'s code for "surrender". So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion. Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion. Compellin\' evidence, statements from residents. Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence. From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire. The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva. DNA directly linked to the psycho. Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0. For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved. A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve. The bullets had names that made the frames shatter. Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter. Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime. Made a hard discovery from one of many signs. While questionin\' a man he picked up on a scanner. He reacted in a loud and agitated matter. And once they tried to read him his rights. He turned cold as ice. '

Look man, when you beat me, I hurt all over and I didn't wanna know from nothin' or nobody, not even my kids. Hell, every fighter knows that hurt and we get sick inside trying to live with it. So don't back off now and make it right for yourself or you'll be sorry you didn't. We held the greatest title in the whole world. You lost that fight for all the wrong reasons. You lost your edge. I walk with a torn ACL, jump on stage with L. I met Dizaster in the cage by myself. The Don Dada Big Poppa do Krav Maga. I put Dizaster vs Marshall Mathers any day,. [Outro: 'Rocky III' sample - Apollo Creed (Rocky)]. Listen, it's quiet, isn't it? When you retire, it's too quiet. I mean, we way too young to retire, anyway. Besides, with the right touch, I could promote this thing into the biggest gate of all time. It'd be bigger than ours. Heaven knows I don't mind bein involved with large numbers right?. (I don't need this no more, I don't want this no more). "

Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster. A clip, a folder and. his grip on a boulder bolster. They supposed ta know, it show when his aura glow. Get from out the row. when he get dough it\'s horrible. Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess. of chicken chest S. Yes ya\'ll the dub will get ya trickles. The best ballers pitch in to rub together nickels. But tut tut, he about to change the price again. It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen. (Villain!) Villain here, have em shrillin\' in fear. And won\'t stop top billin\' til he a gazillionaire. Grillin\' stare, yeah ya boy had drama. Got em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma. Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke. Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke. I thought I told em "Firing pins was separate". He find out later when he tries to go and rep it. Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah. Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta. One monkey don\'t stop no slaughter. A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border. Know the drill, it ain\'t worth the overkill. Flow skill, still there\'s no thrill. Villa bill ya ten K bills in his pilla. Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with.... [Verse 2]. Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix. Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick. Sketch lyric,. Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick. Sick slick, hidden in a book. The only way they find it if you\'re spittin\' in a hook. Listen, don\'t look now, keep walkin\'. Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin\'. Hawk men stalkin\' hear that we hawkin\' often. Coughing to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then. He\'s like Worf, some say stronger though. Off the top Jay Strongbow. play along bro. Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show. Flow slow as Mongo. Don Juan thong pro. For ya info when he\'s not practicing Jim Crow. Or actressin\' and some nympho bimbo. He\'s playin\' Ray J the old tape. DOOM - well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape. Fill it to the rim like brim. Villain and ya won\'t find him in no gym. Probably a foggy bog with the frogs. as he squat on a log. Half cocked and half baked. Used to keep a full stock of work, half rock and half shake. My mistake,. sign a track agreement. For more G\'s than lines and cracks in the cement. In any event it\'s fake like wrestling. Get em like Jake The Snake on mescalines. Ahem, elixir for the dry throat. Tried to hit the high note,. Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote. By remote,. send in the meat wagon. Bragging MC\'s packed in with they feets draggin\'. These stats are staggerin\'. Had his PhD in indiscreet street hagglin\'. Villain, his agenda is clear. Endin\' this year with dividends to spare, here. It\'s not meant for the seein\'. Went through the ceiling after entering his center being. A new meanin\' to sales through the roof. Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof. It\'s the return of the tramp. Who do a duet jam when Ernest Goes To Camp. For the right earn - na\'mean like Vern. We need some more oil for the machines to burn. Jiminy crickets. He gets lucky like winnin\' free tickets off SimplyLyrics. One man\'s waste is another man\'s soap. Sons fan base know the brotha man\'s dope. A real weirdo with a bug-rear flow. And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow. He wears a mask so the charge won\'t grab. On a rooftop with a large stone slab. talk white and thought niggerish. Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish. Black licorice and equally as yucky. How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie. Monkey hustle. man on fire. Later for the date than the Hadron Collider. And cost more. DOOM leave the competition steamin\' like a pile. Smile, ding! Sparkling jewels. In effect like alternate side of the street parkin\' rules. Fools, the roach was never dead. Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head. Instead it was depicted as flicked in. Split, the wick\'s lit. "We have got to try and find Doom!". "Good luck!". '

S'This is man\'s best friend, whoopty-woo. The flag is black, red and blue. True shoot from the hoopty, dogs jump out of dooly. Polonium, pandemonium with a dose of unknownium. The Soviet Hugo Rodier. Fourth generation roper report. Everything I was taught bore resemblance to my thoughts. The truth and design of the Guggenheim rhyme. Where every line is weaponized then applied. Mob shit, talk it acquisition is sick. I don\'t miss when I twist the 556. Stand there with arms folded, firearms make me look large and bloated. ("I\'ma gonna have to project my voice"). Equipment check, church bells time. ("Some of this stuff might get intense"), one more time. Just kill \'em \'Bus, ain\'t nobody around to witness nothing. Heavens devil strangle Hell\'s Angel with a mic cable. Then J Wells came through. "Voice 1: "Yo, the niggas that use to have a nigga a little nervous was like; B.I.G., \'Pac...". Voice 2: "Right". Voice 1: "...Even Canibus, like, Eminem but them niggas got me like...". Voice 2: "If we go at it dawg we gotta go HARD!". I support a secure change of custody. Don\'t trust the beat, trust me Canibus the MC. Without moving my neck I turn to the left. Yes I am the best you\'ll learn to respect. Till your death, Hip-Hop is the body, you are the chest. I am the vest, we are sworn to protect. Fuck your Blood Diamonds, I\'d rather laugh dying. Miners in the mine shaft crying. Reach 80? degrees North, 14? degrees East. Beneath the ice sheet lies the Spitsberg Beast. BRAVO! I fell in love with Suzanne Malveaux. On the down-low, now you know. She talked to the Canibus man. Code name: Javelin Fangz. With \'Nothing to Prove\' to the rap fans. Could elaborate further but suffice to say. "Goddamn that MC made my day". He\'s a butcher, a baker, a vapor box maker from Jamaica. Still talking trash to the haters. '

Now have a choice to be who you wants to be. It\'s left uppa to me, and my momma n\'em told me. (yes she did). I said I have a choice to be who you wants to be. It\'s left uppa to me, and my momma n\'em told me. [Verse 3: Cee-Lo]. I\'m so tired, it\'s been so long - struggling, hopelessly. Seven and forty days.. heyyy. Oh lord, I\'m so tired, I\'m so tired.

Niggas hang around cause of who you are. You get a lot of love cause of what you got. Say they happy for you but they really not. Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz. Swoll up in the spot, now you losing friends. All you wanna do is give the world your heart. Record label tried to make you compromise your art. You make a million dollars, make a million mo\'. First class broad treat you like a nigga po\'. You wanna say "Wait!" but you\'re scared to ask. As your world starts spinning and it\'s moving fast. Tryin\' to stay sane is the price of fame. Spending your life trying to numb the pain. You shake that load off and sing your song. Liberate the minds, then you go on home... [Verse 5: Big Rube]. I must admit, they planted a lot of things. In the brains and the veins of my strain. Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine. From them whores, from the flame. From a post in the game. Makes it hard to maintain focus. They\'re from the Glock rounds, and lockdowns, and burials. The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts. Cause it\'s a hard row to ho. If your ass don\'t move, and the rain don\'t fall. And the ground just dry. But the roots are strong, so some survive. You got more juice than Zeus. Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten. Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti. But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded. Melanin silicon and collagen injected. We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy. It\'s like that red sprite, you can\'t imagine it. Unless you lookin at the canvas of life. And not through the peephole of mortality. Single minded mentality. Gettin over on loopholes. Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities. Clickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel. Packing steel. Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though. I don\'t we in Kansas no mo\' though. Midwest or Dirty South. Clean dressed or dirty mouth. Whether robbin preachers. killin Poor Righteous Teachers. And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals who babble. Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs. Though the mane on your head say the story. As you downplay your glory. Cacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethern happen. Just by rappin... LIBERTAD. '

From the body of this death?. Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust. Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath. Failing to connect cause I'm morally defect. By reason of the God inside my head. Causing me to see only what pertains to me. Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead. Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth. Cause I can't see past my own vanity. If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it. From my mind because it has to be insanity. Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me. From the body of this death?. Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor. In this staged interpretation of this day. Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light. Too intelligent to see it's me in the way. What a paradox, having God trapped in a box. All this time professing to be spiritual. Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness. That thou mayest be saved from thy deception. Trust in the Lord with all thy heart. And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways. Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct our paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him. We grin and shake hands,. then lay ambush for the man. Who has a different point of view then us. Why still do evil, we don't know how to do good. Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear. Fruit of itself except in the vine. I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that lives in me. And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit. Without me, you can do nothing. Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you. I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me.

Pane in the windows of a once happy home. I?m a Cheshire Cat laughin? at the caged birds' song. A caterpillar shroomin usin? fumes from my bong. Lust in my loins, vengeance in my heart. Thrust from my groin that could populate an Ark. Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark. I can?t let come to light so I might suffocate the spark. That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart. Opinions of my health, my self, and wealth go off the chart. My struggle to keep balance ain?t a challenge it?s an art.

Growth from the rain of the previous years. I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears. Yeah. As Summer\'s heatwaves ascended in it\'s splendid manner. Green was flooding our scene, although the skin was tanner. "Fuck The Police!!". jumpin over radio scanners. It was hot in the shade. wet paint all over the canvans. Fuck Vanilla Ice cones, we had T, Cube\'s Amerikka\'s Most. And wanted that Chronic.  on the Left-Coast. Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming. Backstrokin\' through Dark Sides and . Illmatic beginnings. Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum. It was 2 Live, Florida crews caught heat for rappin\'. But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives. And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride. The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide. Strictly 4 My Niggas. that were ready to die in the ride. I wish the summer\'s vibe could\'ve lasted forever. To bad we had to have a change in that weather, that shit was beautiful. Lauryn Hill:. Seasons Change, mad things rearrange. Ladybug:. Play me in the winter. Play me in the summer. Play in the autumn. Any order. Andre 3000:. Trees bright and green turn yellow brown, autumn caught em. See all them leaves must fall down. Verse 3: [Kno]. As the East vs. West winds blew, causing two. Legends to Fall like maple leaves from escalated beef. Assumed that the worst was over. Til these cats started wearing shiny costumes like the 31st of October. The weather\'s colder, but the word jacket/jack it. Is what they did to people\'s styles. Not what they covered they backs with. Tactics of the skill impaired. No Limit. to what they\'ll do when the green is scarce. Some be Thanksgiving for who they know. While others get jerked for loot. Cause getting signed ain\'t a turkey shoot. No respect for the pilgrims who paved the way so you could rock that. Just pop crap and Plymouth Rock-Rap. Beyond gimmicks and fake plastic tits. Outkast and Raekwon dropped fall classic discs. Born to Roll, so I\'m taking you back to school days of autumn. Before the bottom dropped out in 2K. [Verse 4: SOS]. By the dawn of the new millennium we saw bright chains. Winter brought along platinum causing the ice age. No more Gold. , no more YO! MTV RAPS. Now we got R&B cats stealing classic rap tracks. In winter it\'s snowed in like the temperature\'s below ten. Citizens open up shows for more snowmen. Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men. And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin. Jolly, fat, white men get paid when rap hits the shelves. And artists themselves get treated like Elves. Matter of fact, Santa\'s gotten so greedy when a rapper sells. You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells. What the hell! You need cells and 2 ways for chicks to bone ya?. And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia. Even at the beaches of Daytona it\'s gotten colder. But it\'s about time for the cycle to start over (echo). How we gon\' start it?. '

And black Americans never did accept me. I felt the lighter they was, the better that they life is. So I resented them and they resented me. Cheated on light skin Dominique when we was seventeen. I figure I\'d hurt her, she evidently hurt me. I\'d never let a light broad hurt me. That?s why I strike first. and the verse cuts deep. [Hook: Chrisette Michele]. From a light-skinned girl. to a dark-skinned brother. Shade doesn?t matter, heart makes the lover. Boy you?re so beautiful, boy you\'re so beautiful. Shadee doesn?t matter, heart makes the lover. Honey brown, caramel, coffee brown, chocolate. Toffee, pecan, licorice, boy you\'re so beautiful. Just another knotty-haired nigga. Hoping Wes Snipes make my life a bit different. In middle school I had to write to be timid. I had beautiful words but girls never listened. Listen; blacker the berry, sweeter the powder. Well I\'m fruit punch concentrate and they water. Walk into my room thinking how to make moves. Ain\'t thinking like a student but how Ice-T\'d do it. Light dudes had the girls looking there all year. It?s not fair, the ones with the good hair. Couldn?t adapt to naps, I wear caps. I hate black. Skin tone I wish I could take it back. Or rearrange my status maybe if I was khaki. Associating light skin with classy. The minstrel show showed a me that was not me. They say "black is beautiful," but ask them beautiful. Light girls if it\'s black they attract to usually. What if Barack\'s skin was all black, truthfully. Would he be a candidate or just a blackened community?. We as black dudes tend to lack unity. And them blacker girls ain\'t on the tube usually. Right now at 23 I ain\'t mad at them reds no more. But for long time I had gone cold. Blindfolded my own insecurity was holding me back. To reds I ain\'t know how to act. They would get the cold shoulder and know it was an act. A defense mechanism, what I thought that I lacked. Confidence. '

The apparitions have been drinking this water for too long. So when they gather by the birdbath in the morning he will tell em. I mean no disrespect, but you have all outstayed your welcome. Interesting, in a sense. Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence. How quickly they will lift their heads. And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue. Said you're living by the bayonet, but how alive are you. Shit, A is all juice and bad etiquette. Elbows on the table,. How alive, too alive. And one by one around the yard til each one felt communal pride. Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public. With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs. We the legends that hunt with the unremembered. Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor. Who snuck around the art police and all related governments. To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip. Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly. No story goes untold, Aes is back. I got a handful rocking the same poker face. Down to dance around the table like they own the place. I got the whole world thinking it's a holiday. Cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away. "

Start running like you\'re looking for P.C. Protective... custody. Cuz I\'m blowing off, just for going off. You may think I\'m showing off, cuz every rhyme is flowing off.

Thirty-two degrees below zero. The Genius, is a rap professor. Casual dresser, you may dress fresher. But the way I speak is so poetic. Even if you roll up strapped with an uzi. Still your wack lyrics couldn\'t [Do Me!!]. You got germs, worms, plus a lack of respect. I\'ll be teachin, you couldn\'t handle. A style like mine, I dismantle. On, professors, in college. I stomp em out just with supreme knowledge. I go off, and off men often. See the December\'s Primatene Mist coughin. Cuz I\'m the God building hard never barred. You have some MC\'s who get too hyped. From a ten word rhyme it took em hours to type. That\'s not MCing, just an MC being. Weak on his words and never thinkin bout freeing. Positive thoughts that I let come out. I\'m The Genius of this, I know what it\'s about. Cuz on the mic I\'m a leader, school I am a reader. When it comes to sex, a strong good breeder. MC\'s max but every one I wax. And collect the cash money without being taxed. Now that I have your attention, I\'d like to mention. Don\'t battle me at any rap convention. If so I\'ll show all who wants to know. To detemine who\'s an amateur and who is a pro. Don\'t mean to get ill, cuz I know how you feel. You lack words like mines, talent and skill. '

Drink it all away, numb it down to none. Stay awake tonight and wait for the sun. You say you hate your life, you ain\'t the only one. Let your frustration out the gate and watch the pony run. One double, for the hunger and the struggle. Two for the fool tryin\' to pull apart the puzzle. Three now I smile while I wait for your rebuttal. By the fourth shot,.

Swallow it and leave her empty bottle on the table. Let the past fall, making faces at that clock on the back wall. Countdown to the last call. Ask all these people that make sounds. "How long does it take for the pace to break down?". Another lonely little trophy. If only I could walk a straight line, I\'d make it home free. And everybody in this bar thinks they know me. And my story like "poor me" ("Yeah, pour me another, homie!"). I can count the days till you come back. Or I can follow them sun-rays down to the train tracks. I can stumble drunk over hope and love. Or I could just keep drinkin\' until I sober up (hey waitress). [Verse 4]. Bottles and pints, and shots and cans. Couches and floors, and drunk best friends. Models and whores,. tattooed hands. Cities and secrets. cats and vans. Good times, laughter, bad decisions. Strippers and actors, and average musicians. Mornings after and walks of shame. The bartender knows me by my real name. '

I call it thief because she took it. Put the key in the hole and started upsetting cruise control. Mapping out a plan to put me back in her eyes. She laid her hand on my thigh. Damn near went blind.

S'90210. She live her whole life like T.V. And she would do anything for everything. Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go. Part-time waitress she really want to make it. In the "City of Lights", it\'s hard to see clear. She don\'t really care about anyone advice. And nothing here\'s real, and everyone\'s alike. Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire\'s life. She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light. Indulging a meal when a toilet\'s in sight. Expose those fries, can\'t hold those down. To read for Seven Pounds, you must release several pounds. This is how she want to live. But she ain\'t really tripping, she\'s on Beverly Hills. Just another day out in Beverly Hills. She sing, model, and dance,. but can\'t sit still. Believing the screens or anything there. But reality shows ain\'t real. So pretentious with no potential. She goes to catch up, although her rent\'s up. In her defense she a part of the crowd. She going to borrow some money. So she can party at Chows. Graduated from Ros?, addicted to blow. Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow. So she kisses the stars. And she gives them a blow. Inhibitions is gone, she just want to be known. She want to be know, she just want to be known. Pulling down her skirt. "I never done this before". Nah. You know big-breast girls. Never ever pay rent. They meet them rich boys. Throw D\'s on that bitch. Lease on the whip. Beach on the weekend. Hotel suite, room keys is a gift. Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger. Now you just a whore to the known entertainers. Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick. The sun\'s always out. But it\'s clouds over here. Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction. To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims. Hold on you can see my vision. Next time you look down on a nigga. '

S'Boring typing, snoring pipe when hyper than four hype men. Excited writing, trifling times ten. Long stay, songs play, gone haywire, wrong way. On the interstate, integrate all day. It\'s just a small phase, that\'s what them all say. Then fall prey in a mini-mall hallway. Meant to be sold, not told to friendly enemies. Remember these intentionally, empathy please. Silent moment. violent prone atonement. Miles a minute on a microphone. on rent, loan spent. No debt, has bet, fast get, cash jet. Master McSmash, Asterix stashed it last. Not least, pass the pot of hot grease. Geese shot. not easily spotted plot, cease snot release. Hold your insulting tongue and mark his words well. Or end up to the curb and shocked by third rail. Get the message by bird mail or turds flail. Villain man, best nerd male you heard wail. An absurd tale of books, nooks and crannies. Or plan B, when in Rome go back home. And get real dome from a well-known crack gnome. He talk to himself when he need someone to hate on. The black-McCain campaign, negative debate-a-thon. who\'s zooming who?. Ever since he first started the art, it\'s been worth it. Soon to charter a stint on part of the Chitlin\' Circuit. Word kid, get your ticket from the telepath. "Wicked, wicked, wicked" on electroencephalograph. '

S'The beat\'s just ridiculous, the lyrics articulate. Feels good, as if a girl just touched her clitoris. Sucker MC\'s, I\'m killing \'em, I\'m so sick of seeing \'em. Silly (shit) when they rhyme, like that red rugby shirt worn by Gilligan. Plus the hat, they (shit) is wack. When you see me coming take ten steps back. I make usage of the pronouns, adjectives, verbs. My granny says "You always had a way with words". And that\'s because my word is bond, lyrics are laws. Sucker MC\'s look at me like I\'m friggin\' eye sore. Heere comes a brother hipping others on the style they lack. I\'ve always rhymed abstract,. the brother named Abstract. I am the earner of the soul in mine. Forget the physical cause the physical will die with time. Like (niggas) using Clinton loops as if they owned the publishing. It\'s not the 187 when the 360 slept. It\'s the kid who peeled the jeans in Orleans off of Leslie. Ayo, that\'s it from me, Plug 3, and Ali explode!. When I rhyme, the effect just ripples. You sound sick, I hope your cells get sickles. And formulate into real stiff (shit). Then I bet that (niggas) cut the chit chit. Cause the Ab will, be sharper than a Ginsu. Cutter or your bum (ass) head for the gutter. This is not a game and we ain\'t looking for the fame. That\'s not the aim, we came to rip the jam out the frame. My inter-reaction with paper is amazing. So needless to say mad trails are left blazing. A whole lot of bull(shit) rhymes start to get play. But I\'m here to say that real rhymes do pay. I make a girl do the bogle, doo doo brown and all. Make (niggas) jump up, drink Dom, and have a ball. I ainimate the unlively with the verbal combat. The Abstract, never the wack. Motivator of the many like Moses. Moving through, bringing danger to the dummies that poses. Real down to Earth I hit the Long Island Rail. You never see me tango with the horn and the tail. I got the kit for your mind I design it like Zender. It\'s about a million brothers trying to be MC\'s in this world. I\'m glad I got a baby girl. '

S'I live life like the captain of a sinking ship. The one thing that I can guarantee. I\'m like a stepping razor, I suggest you stay fair with me. Been paying dues for a decade plus. Before that I was just another face on the bus. Tappin\' my foot, to the beat on the radio. Dreaming bout the mic and the money and the ladies. Oh mom, I promise I\'m gonna be large. Some day I\'m gonna stop trying to borrow your car. Gonna go far, with charisma and skill. Until they put my face on a million dollar bill. Atmosphere, it\'s just a ten letter word. Discretion is the name of my cement feathered bird. And if you didn\'t hear, then fuck what others heard. I think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured. Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix. I\'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek. It\'s not that I don\'t like you, I just don\'t want to speak. You fucking freak, now keep your days out my week. The world keeps a balance, through mathematics. Defined by whatever you\'ve added and subtracted. I\'m pushin\' on the hammer to trigger the brain. Embrace how I live, cause God loves ugly. God loves ugly, God loves ugly. Once upon a time in Minneapolis, yo. I damn near had to steal the show. I stepped on the stage - "Who is it?". My name\'s Slug, I\'ve come to kill a couple minutes. And what\'s up with the way that everybody gathers around. Each other, so they can steal each others\' sound. If it\'s all about getting down, with the get down. How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?. Appears more clear in its simplest form. Nobody sees tears when you\'re standin\' in the storm. Abandonin\' the norm, and handlin\' the harvest. Measurin\' the worth by the depth of the hardship. I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name. I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game. When the soldiers started runnin\' short on rations. I began tappin\' the egg to spark the hatchin\'. Make it happen, and take this captain to the gallows. I keep steering us into an area that\'s shallow. Talking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry. Said, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury. So give me some light, a little love and some liquid. I\'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot. And when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow. I\'ll float atop the flood holdin\' on to my ugly. [Verse 3]. Why scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen. Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream. Or be the deer that\'s caught in my high beams. I\'m rolling with the brights on. Scared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with. Paranoid, walking around, careless. No wonder you\'re in love with your therapist. Go to sleep my little time bomb. '

I ain't saying I don't fuck with all these other niggas. I'm just saying im above all these other niggas. Fake hugs from all these fuck niggas. No love for all these sucka niggas. Feeling like Shawn Carter before the diamond. You know that sort of rhyming was sort of head of its timing. I got that same hunger, Rock-a-fella chain hunger. That going through some things. Cause they don't hear the shit im saying hunger. Under ya nose a rose grew with no sun at all. Feeling like Ros? before Jay. And guess who my nigga tell 'em is on the way. You in debt to the game success is expected. Fucking with ricky got me working relentless in sessions. Work ethic respected by several record executives. There was a time when they hated all the southern rappers. Now all them rappers looking for southern to rap on. I be liking this mula, its gone talk if you have it.

S"Little nigger tryna bubble up from the crack scene. How could I fly so high, only to feel so low?. How do they live so fast only to grow so slow?. Like when you showing no support for your kids. But got money for marijuana just to smoke with your friends. Or that woman who survives and beats cancer. Only to be drowned in debt with no answers. Some wack-job haul off and smoke his whole family. Reality T.V. that's not based in reality. Rich boy kill his own wife, knocks her teeth out. Cuts her fingers off, then escapes with a suicide. The king of pop died,. Michael Vick was fighting dogs. But he walked and did his time, let him throw the fucking ball. Narcissistic society, love paparazzi. [Verse 3: Trick Trick]. I done been in situations where the only thing that I could do was read the Bible. I'm carrying seven-point-six-twos to fistfights. I ain't fitting to be the topic of the preacher's eulogy speech. "

And a selfish soldier wit pride that was ordered to die. A burnin\' star in the sky. my heart is warped wit a drive. Expressin\' thoughts through a rhyme my metaphors are alive. It\'s like I\'ve been crucified. they hate me now like Nas. They punctured me through my side the bleeding was cauterized. I was revived after I died. Only then I saw how I was truly admired and worshipped like a god. Let the world know the truth but it became my demise. Sometimes I feel like killin\' myself they\'ve stolen my shine. I wanted to be the illest for a moment in time. From the ink to my pen to my pad to the ink in my arm. How can one diss song possibly last this long?. Tyson ain\'t the champ no more them days is gone. And Rip the Jacker ain\'t too stubborn to say when he\'s wrong. I should get twenty dollars and go to Econo Lodge. And tie the sawed-off trigger around the doorknob. Call the police squad and tell them I\'m in room one oh five. And that a dirty bomb\'s inside. playin\' Christy Lane. "One Day at a Time Sweet Jesus" is playin\'. Deploy or detach on land you the man. COMSAT. Tell them you need suppressive fire for troops in the back stat. Insurgence and counter-insurgence move wit a purpose. Absolutely mission critical you never get nervous. Applicate the shock tube to the surface. Standby blow it eyes open wit the scope on the terrorist. Tell him to go to hell in Arabic put a bullet through his narrow neck. Watch the wall behind him get wet. I\'m an animal I\'ll murder you and stare at your pets. Get the tape I know where the surveillance cameras is kept. If you want a confession you got it, you want product? Gimme $20 You want gossip? I\'ll give you logic on any topic. Recordin\' the positive data. Rip is the best rapper go confirm the status. One million page dissertation written on paper. Cheap label from Pitney Bowes\' tree curator. My purification process is greater. But thinly tapered verbatim. My album is equal to over fifty acres. Can-I-Bus before the Big Bang. And after the big crunch. opethicus afarensis. four delivered talaria. And Space Harrier\'s life\'s last barrier. '

Murder, murder, kill, kill, kill. [Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]. Hogtie the capo all up,. beheaded the driver. Left the bitch in the back with no tongue as the survivor. Raw dog, spit in her mouth.

Let's break the surface and make a little happy mess. Whoo girl, you're the most beautiful thing I've seen. Enticing, exciting. Even the sound of your voice gotta nice ring. Ya seem like the type that might help me tighten up my pipe dreams. We can keep digging through this dirt. Team up, you and I against the universe. Think about it, What cha say to yourself. You can wear my cape and I can play with your belt. The truth is there now. Stand with me, look into that mirror now. And tell me you don't see the same image. Gonna be a brand name babe once the rain is finished. I can't believe she got me on a ball and chain. It's not a complaint, I appreciate it. For all the dumb mistakes I make. I'm surprised baby girl ain't threw me away. I never meant to hurt no one. I just want to stay productive till the work is done. I dance to a certain drum. But when I fell off beat you didn't turn and run, no. You see me at my lowest moments. You gave me sight when I had broken focus. With a smile that opens up like a rose does. Even when it all seemed so fucking hopeless. And here you are, right in front of me. Offering it all like 'tell me what you want from me'. I want to thank you today and forever.

S'And dad made it until maybe a year later. When they found his suicide inside of a grain elevator. Got over it, I had no other offers or options. Thought about whether or not mom and pop was watching. Never bothered with caution, no time for fear. Saw my folks carry fear for most my early years. And I learned from it, turned numb and ignored the storm. A burning sun waiting for the world to plummet. He taught me how to count all the way up to 100 proof. From watching him I learned how to gather nourishment. Living off the different women that he had to nurture him. And on the surface I became a normal pre-teen. More afraid of nuclear war than snake bites and bee stings. My best friend was my TV. It\'s nothing but sunshine. It\'s all sunshine. It\'s nothing but sunshine. Now it\'s been 17 summers since I\'ve seen my mother. But every night I see her smile inside my dreams. When I was younger I didn\'t actually see the accident happen. But every night I see her smile as it shatters against the screams. I can only imagine Dad\'s internal reaction. Strain, inferno burning, bound in his brain. What\'s it take to make a man who owns acres of land. Abandon the family plan and drown himself in his grains. I\'m glad I left that farm in Northern Minnesota. Where the time moves slower and the winters are colder. 26 years of age, no longer full of rage. I think it\'s safe to say I\'ve turned a page on my childhood days. "Ay yo look Ma, I\'m a productive member of society. When I\'m drunk I make noise, but otherwise I live quietly". And on the weekend I go back up north to reminisce. Remember what it was like pretending to be a kid. Late at night I walked the fields and lurk in the shadows. Getting even with life by murdering cattle. Cow Skit. It\'s all sunshine. It\'s nothing but sunshine. It\'s all sunshine. '

And I got welts on my mind to signify all my accomplishments. Progress will never rest, in the hand that has no head. Bought my brain a cane and asked it to be my pimp. You know, to make sure I don\'t get stuck up in my fuck ups. A little overanxious I was, to bust nuts. And find the answers making love. Out of a canvas full of touch-ups. I dip my brush into the what I\'ve wept for. And wonder out loud as I can, how long I\'ve slept for. I should rob a pet store, let the dogs wild. I should close all the schools just to make the kids smile. Seize the limit, let the sky be the moment. Put the key to the ignition, I\'mma ride these donuts. And when it breaks, lock the door, walk away. Won\'t be nothin else to talk about, nothin else to say. I\'m just waiting for the moment I can break away. The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-UrQPl00iJYsLS-4T6WloXg"); });See I\'m just waiting for the moment, I can break away. The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day. I\'m just waitin for the moment, I can break away... Let\'s stand on the corner, throw rocks at people. So there\'s no surprises, written off as evil. I sleep next to women that I don\'t deserve. They like to hurt my pride, while I work their nerves. Once upon a time, it was worth it. When the urges get fed. And the purpose finds a path to the surface. Is respect considered a breakfast food?. I\'m guilty of the type of attitude that wrecks your mood. The truth can be pain, and I hate to do it. Either face the music, or get away from me stupid. Super glue it down, now it better not move. See I\'m not the best, but I\'m in the top two. And I\'m not that friendly, when this cup is empty. It\'s a side effect from trying to find the fucks that sent me. See I didn\'t just happen, I was made this way. See I gave up lying, but I still tiptoe. I\'m as stubborn as they come, and I\'m known to hit low. If I had a chisel, I would carve out a hole. For me to hide in everytime the mighty wind blows. Since no one knows, where the hell we gonna go. I\'mma stand right here, until the end of the show. I\'mma clap my hands, so don\'t pass the chance. To unsnap my pants, get on my lap and dance. No longer am I mad about the things I don\'t have. All I\'m living for is love and laughs. The last starfighter\'s weapons were rendered useless. So we pulled the scissors and cut the cord to end this music... (Ending). You want the fucking window rolled up. You roll up the fucking window you piece of shit!. Don\'t fucking talk to me like that. Don\'t fucking talk to me at all!. You act so fucking ugly!. '

S'Ain\'t thinking about no hope no more. I got my boots I kick it till I get with. Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum. Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown. What goes round comes round from. M.L.K. to Cascade. Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side. Up in they rides. Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time. Then selling dimes, now its quarter keys, stacking G\'s. Knowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame. The fact the only way a brother can survive the game. It ain\'t just the police. We kill each other just lost another brother. Fast living will get you took. Thinking it can\'t happen to you and then it do. Off crooked schemes its just a dream. Floating face down in the mainstream. [Hook]. Think it is when it ain\'t all peaches and cream. That\'s why some are found floating face down in the mainstream. They swan diving. Fit they name be Gretchen von Ivan. Volkoff rushin\' to finish their album then you find them. Lost, dog paddling, back stroking, what done happened?. Be rhyming "catch of the day" when the recipe calls for "blackened". Wrong ingredients. Maybe too much herbs and spices. Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish. Of them greens. and it\'s enticing how them Jones\'s sing. So I\'m gonna sing just like them to get where they at. I bite whatever that\'s looking tasty, water it down then swallow. I hope you vomit, won\'t call no names cause that\'s not my job. It just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are. But if you don\'t you never will, you just receive the steel. But then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel. The way that I felt when I wrote this. but we must stay in focus. We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers. I let you stay in my crib, now you know where I live. When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal, look at the hand you deal. Me crudball business nigga giving inches so here, take a foot. Luck only counts in rabbit\'s feet and horseshoes. Experience is sometimes the best teacher. until we get our own plate. I hope you don\'t mind me eating off of yours. Process sm-m-moking like Jerry. Meanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery. Never to attain another level of conscience. Only to test, the potency. But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say. "I wish I never did what I did", now face this bid. It was the company you kept, the many places you slept. When you shouldn\'t have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap. Contributing to sin. and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10. Got you niggas where they want you again. Floating face down in the mainstream. Thats why, thats why, thats why. Everybody\'s a player, rubbing them Kangols on their head. Thinking its all about your clothes, nigga its all about your self. The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with. Your friends and family. up and down like hoes give head. every month thinking I\'ll let that fire roll. Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even. My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven. In the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish. '

The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead?. Never, impossible,. pull out black burners like tonsils. Two Gallants, hitting if we got to. Busting at y'all niggas daily. Sucking your teeth cause God chain. Like Ghostface this, Ghostface that. Ghost sold crack, now we revelations spoken through rap. Velour-ed down like the Sheikh of Iran. Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands. it's me against housing. Extraordinary pro-black, sold God creations to control thousands. Frederick Douglass. A-yo, how can I move the crowd?. First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed. Here's the instructions, put it together. It's simple ain't it? Well, quite clever. [Bridge: Ghostface]. Marvin, Marvin, you were a friend of mine.

Show these niggas how the way we dance. Hot night, Jamaica. Truck,. two rappers got stuck that night. I ain't saying no names, they know who, thank you for the change. Cali weed. 30 seconds til we tear and decease. Quick, call all my seeds dipped in the crowd. The ho spotted me, he knew not to call my name out. He walked off softly, we exactly. Formed like Christ and the disciples. Your favorite rappers dropping they drinks. On the low tucking they links. We made eighty off the books. One of the illest since Magic Johnson. , no disrespect. But metaphors'll keep me out the projects. Rap connects'll keep me correct. A-yo, I wrote this on Donnie roof. After his funeral, on one knee. Thinking his killer's following me. So to my nigga Donnie, up there. Can you please tell God that we fucked up here?. You got beer, weed, guns, AIDS. All these obstacles, it's hard to make it nowadays. Why's the Devil winning, some say it's our fault. If that's the answer, you know smoking cause cancer. Let me drop a bracelet, leave a chain behind. My tape stay at the beginning cause that's how they rewind. Y'all know how we dine, we don't eat swine, and we don't drink wine. If you don't bring me some motherfucking cognac, I kill you. I can't feel you. Ain't in my senses, and you ain't in my dollars. I fuck with rottweilers, no leashes, no collars. Brolic scholars. "

Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory. For the dominion. Who will dominate the opinion. Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion. Conformin' our vision. To the world church's decision. Trapped in a section. Submitted to committee election. Moral infection. Epidemic lies and deception. Insurrection. Of the highest possible order. Destortin' our tape recorders. From hearin' like under water. Beyond the borders. Find the sin in disorder. Bound by the strategy. A systematic depravity. Heavy as gravity. Head first in the cavity. Without a bottom. A fate, worse than Sodom. What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits. Truth comes, we can't hear it. When you've been, programmed to fear it. I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision. Apallin', callin' religious. Some program on television. How can, dominant wisdom. Be recognized in the system. Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules. Intelligent fools. PhDs in illusion. Masters of mass confusion. Bachelors in past delusion. Now who you choosin'?. The head, or the tail. The bloodshed of the male. Or confidence in the tale. Conferences is Yale. Discussin' doctrines of Baal. Causin' people to fail. Keepin' the third in jail. His word has nailed. Everything to the tree. Severing all of me. From all that I used to be. Formless and void. Totally paranoid. Enjoy darkness as Lord. Keepin' me from the sword. Bitter than cerasee. Hungry and thirsty. For good meat we would eat. And still, dined at the table of deceit. How incomplete. The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision. Inwardly, only water can purge the heart. From words to fiery darts. Thrown by the workers of the arts. Your whole philosophy is paper thin. The wide road is insanity. Could it be all of humanity. Picture that. Scripture that. The origin of a man's heart is black. Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore. Achin' in sores. Babylon, the great mystery. Where there's no repentance there can be no admission. And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam. atom bomb. Minister Farrakhan. The majority hasn't a clue. Search the chapters, check the verses. Recapture the land. Remove the mark from off of our hands. In agreement with his command. Everything else is damned. Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand. It's freedom, said it's freedom time now. It's freedom, said it's freedom time now. It's freedom, I'mma be who I am. It's freedom time, said it's freedom time. Everybody knows that they guilty, yes. Resting on their conscience eating their insides. Get free, be who you're supposed to be. "

S"How long I thought that I would be allowed atop this trash heap. I didn't answer cause I'm tired of criticizing the masses. Inspired the support the devouring of the self. All the power to the people who dig potholes. Placed me in a glass case full of lost treasures and fossils. Got a right to be hostile, my love is gettin' gang raped. By an army full money hungry crocodiles. Quantity is up, market in a flood. But the party over here has never steered through so much love. I'll take the laughter, but I'd rather have the women. Who am I kiddin'? I'll be content with whatever I'm given. Work for food, rent, sex, money, or water. I don't know what else that you have to offer. Your first born daughter? No need, already got her. She came to the set hungry and left hot and bothered. My posse's full of women, computer nerds, and thugs. Much to my dismay, I'm none of the above. Someday I'mma be the mack of the minute. And you were so damn good I'mma have to forget it. Listen to the mimic, it's almost on. Drink, til ya hit me with a tall potion. Think quick, how much more insult. Will it take for me to break your light bulb. Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet. It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target. Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain. Check your mail, climb your ladder. Count the pieces you've managed to gather. Does it matter? What are you trying to achieve?. Let go of your throat if you're dying to breathe. And finally we've begun to make a little progress. Ain't a single dock in this river that can stop us. Lost in the mix like a feeble over dub. Got me screaming at these shippin' till these people know what's up. Open the pipes and tuck that voice in. I'mma sit on this corner and nibble on my poison. Baby once in awhile I find a reason to smile. But most the time it's spent deep in denial. It's all make believe, I want the cake to eat. But this lake's too deep, tryin' to stand on two feet. Wonderin' about the thunder runnin' through this blood. I try to keep my cool, but the hat fits too snug. Study the love, took my degree. Shoved it into a bottle, chucked it into the sea. I am not ugly (reversed). "

Try to test, I leave a bloody-ass mess. Driving a Saab that connects with the mob. Bank job, plenty niggers I rob. Blood stains are on my Ballys. A sucker got rowdy, so I shot him in an alley. Pumped his face full of dum-dums. Then left him for the cast of rats and the bums. I got a crazy, big posse or should I say a crew?. Of niggers that belong in the zoo. Watch you spit up, blood when you get hit up. One in the head, making sure you don't get up. This is what happens and nobody can't stop it. Crack heads searching a dead man's pockets. Ill ville. Posse's roar in a drug war. Cause some believe in death before poor. Shooting galleries for a rich man's salary. Pockets so fat they need dough or low calories. Cause I'm wanted dead or alive like Baby Face Nelson. And I'mma kick you up your ass like Pele. "

Cooling out with ol' girl on a fat-ass date. Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great. Get promoted at your job up to management. Plot a long time finally a plan has made it. Sometimes I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way. When I think of things that make you feel that way. Christmas Day when your mama got your first bike. Type of feeling when you went and won your first fight. How your team felt winning championship games. Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain. Put in hard work finally you're living your dream. Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes. Blind man gain his sight see his first sunrise. Young man speaking out, now he's loud and clear. Birthin' your child, smile so proud you wear. Going in your 3rd eye for the styles you hear. Making music that'll bump for a thousand years. Eating right feeling conscious like health is first. Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work. Summer days more likely that you notice breeze. Winter days more likely that you notice heat. When I'm gone, more likely that you notice me. Dead broke, more appreciation for that scrill(a).

I can look a fool in his pupils and just tell what he about. By analyzing his hand-gestures and what come out his mouth. That come from being from it, experienced and seasoned. From hustling monday through friday, clubbing and going to church on weekends. If you can't cook stay out the kitchen, if you can't swim get out the ocean. Believe half of what you see, and none of what you hear. Analyze that fool before you let him get in your ear. There's three sides to every story, there's mine's, your, and the truth. Niggas loose they lives every day over a boot. ou can fuck around and get stamped, fucking around with a tramp. Running around here loose without no structure in your camp. What niggas need to do is stay up off them phones, (Right?). Bragging about the nigga you popped and killed last night. Cause then the dark gon' come to light, the streets talk.

S"Cause I'm contented to know that I've invented. Poetry which has been highly complimented. Thus how I rhyme is what I feel on stage. And from a fraction of a thought I can write a whole page. I'll just pull a notebook from off the shelf. And like Salt-N-Pepa I express myself. To make most of you know me, and some of you don't. But when it comes to cold challenging, I bet none of you won't. Arrange a battle, improve your style. Against a brother with a totally different profile. Most of you flake cold front ya flex. And hesitate on rhymes that should've been Memorex. But you forgot I remember you're an amateur. Mystery worshipper, now prefer. Let's shake them,wake them, they should be woke. For what? They take MC'ing for a practical joke. You don't have what it takes to be an MC. Ya just as phony as ya wanna be. You present yourself to be the quiet storm. You're a sneaky littlesnake in a devilish form. I invite those to battle me then they're through. Bust it, i'mnot prejudiced you're invited too. I have rhymes to block those who hit below. The belt, that means biting a rhyme. Now you're trapped in the Land Of The Lost. When it's a selfish sore loser like you I choose. To roll your big eyes and suck your buck teeth. Because you're upset that you ever caused beef. Yo homeboy, I never meant to tease. But it's a slaughter, can someone help him please. Feeling uncomfortable, then loosen your belt. Once The Genius gets heated up, suckers will melt. Then after ya melt, ya start dripping like water. Then you can say this was a Goddamn slaughter. Ain't no rhymes like the one I got. They put competitors in a trance, y'all. Radio stations ran them a lot. They made children play and dance y'all. How dare ya mention you're an MC. When the crowd disagrees on who claim to be. Cause your battle piece are the rhymes you release. And that only make the crowd boos increase. Or diving in a pool head first without water. So don't set yourself up to get brutalized. Bit I'm so damn energized, I'm energetic. That I can wreck a microphone 'til it's pathetic. Oka, got it in your head, correct. That I'm victorious on any subject. You disbelieve, then huh, call the title. Then after one rhyme you'll be calling me your idol. It's like..zap...another one on my jock strap. Now you walk around praising my name. Cause I'm slamming and I make you feel the pain. "

Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation. Inside ya, cause I be that hell sure provider. Providing the rhyme that be deep as the Poseidon Adventure. Niggas need to test they freaking temp'ture.

My peoples are you with me, where you at?. Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick. Niggas looking all in my face like they want dick. It's about to hit the fan, hit the floor. That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more. What is it? Niggas think they bigger. Because they got their finger on the trigger of a biscuit. They don't know I'm wicked when I start to kick it. Eat they raw sound, wash it down with a Mistic. Better yet a Snapple. Nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle. Better yet the temple. I'm coming to your town black down. The rental car. the pistol cocked. If you don't want to burn from the Glock. Then beware, I buck shots. The buck stops here, no more dough will be made.

Tried to dip, but he dive, I socialize on vocal vibes. On tracks stabbed up with razor-sharp knives. Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it. Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate. For fat tapes and, then, played out and out of date. Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate. And from that point, the God made a statement. Draftin\' tracements, replacements in basements. Materials in sheet-rock, to sound proof the beatbox. And microscopic optics received through the boxes. Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical. Punchlines, that\'s unstoppable. Ring like shots from Glocks that attract cops. Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop. But we only increase if everything is peace. Father You See King the police. [Hook ].

Well, if you like the way it sounds, then clap, man. But only raise your hands if you\'re sure. Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it. Well, if you livin\' in the world today.

S"It's another roller coaster ride. Walk the path of Jesus, witness if Hell freezes. The mind teases reality, crack the pieces. Nothing eases; being chastise with blood baptize. Guys revise, acknowledge past lives. Statements will be made, acknowledge me. My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me. My mind is the gate to Hell, so try to flee. Both gates look the same, which will it be?. Demons scream from thought process. Enter semen,. child born, stress. Body want to sleep but the mind can't rest. Measure pleasure through financial progress. When it come to currency, love is nonexistent. Foes multiply, friends become so distant. Some hope you die, backstab in an instant. Foes I despise, disguised as allies. To sabotage, camouflage. Loyalty is lies. To see God, look into my eyes. To see the Devil, then you look into my eyes. As I rise from Hell's equator.... Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up. Metal Fingers. feed beats,. Grimm Reaper. eat 'em up. Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up. tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up. Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up. Take air, compress it, bless it. Mix loops like Ku Klux. MF don't give two fucks. Nigga, quarterback blitz, popped, quickly fumble. Leave game with concussion, seeing stars and mumbles. This happens to any emcee that wants to rumble. Dynasties destroyed like Carringtons and Colbys. Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby. Chop that ass in half like Obi-Wan Kenobi. Greatest of all time, God straight up told me. Greatest of all time, the Devil even told me. Icicles on surfaces of sun, we livin' coldly. Prophets be phony. And we attack, we switch like the Wu Tang symbol. Still kill Jack even though quick and nimble, plain and simple. Pick niggas off while they ballin'. And die old like Stalin. Yes, Death, I hear you callin', I accept collect. Human sacrifice, must pay respect. We catch reck, nigga, we catch reck. "

S"The driver was clutching a can of Hi-C. His jacket was tied, to a nearby tree. The autopsies revealed gun shot wounds. Dental records matched to a newlywed groom. This accident, was a cover up for homicide. Sheets investigators, had relied on the media. For help, and to track down the perpetrators. And visited the home, of a topless skeezer. Who was at the bar, when he was last seen alive. Left with him, just ten minutes after they arrived. Despite the police efforts, they turned up nothing. Just an ex-hooker, try'nna get a rep from bluffing. But the wide publicity, had just paid off. From a hard rock inmate, who was just made soft. He said he knew a man who killed the pop star. And almost got caught by a passing cop car. The inmate said probably, the motive was robbery. And knowing this and keeping it a secret, it bothers me. He said this individual killed for low billings. And purchased a murder kit, blocks from the killing. So he co-operated fully, and snitched on his. Chop shop mechanic, who used to move bodies on the pulley. An extortionist, involved in similar incidents. Payments that came in thousand dollar increments. Suspicious activities that flooded the place. So they subpoenaed phone records for the calls was traced. The hair that was taken from his car interior. Was that of a young girl, who felt inferior. She died fighting and probably aroused his anger. Holding off her life, as she faced the strangler. The crime seemed to be sexual from nature. It was substantial evidence, that the nigga raped her. The suspects had marks on his face and chest. But it just wasn't enough, to get an arrest. But it was really something left at the scene, on a small scale. Was the microscopic traces of blood, under her fingernails. "

We was young, dumb, I'm full of cum, yup, we all been. On phones late as fuck with a love on, through yawning. Till morning came. walked home alone in the rain. Smiling, cause I just put my finger all off in her thang. My interest, aged with interest. Fine as fuck, caught a fine for finding my luck. But I can't really have you walk away from family blood. And if I promise I'm your man to be, that's vanity, cause. I love you, I need you, I just can't let you go. But to keep you's to mistreat you, and I'm thinking only heaven knows that.... Yes, it's time to unfasten my belt cause I've been eating with my eyes again. Before you I wasn't receiving all my vitamins. Adoring you forced me to paint the town, now my mind is red. But now my eyes are red, this love is nearly dying dead. This is a body that, I used to lay beside it and. Time and time again, head first diving in. To grab a new spouse would be an uncordial mismatch. But everyday she places razor blades where her wrist at. My boo-boo's got a boo boo, to kiss that cannot fix that. Regardless I try. cause removing her outta my life. Would be like removing a part of the sky. Harder. but if I don't bother to try. I have to keep watching her die, and I don't want to, so.... "

Gold albums on my bronze game, fucking stupid. And I'll fucking do it, new legend shit got me juiced. Remind you of a time there was knowledge in music. And I do it for the niggas that promise the future. New black soul, new black soul, new black soul. And any bitch that got me twisted only grew my fro. Ha, and it's like that, right? Right?.

S"I wish I had a map of the terrain so I could step around the landmines. Avoid the beasts under the bed that bring they bad times. I wanna find this here so-called treasure. The pleasure, the trinkets, the never-ending weekends. Acknowledgin that I'm still just a piece of the sequence. But seein these different footprints got me needin to show my weakness. The timeline, the time zones, I cross them with my eyes closed. Memorized the landmarks and learned the cycles. The weather patterns, how the seasons affect. The East and the West of each region learned the cycles. Forget about the fact that many trails have been tracked. Maybe it's a plus that there's a path. If this was some uncharted land I'd have to be a smarter man. Willing to travel the farthest to unravel the harvest. And natural resources are unlimited. Exploration only requires some desire and initiative. Take your time and find the right way to climb. It ain't safe to play games with natures mind. If I could show you, you would never leave it. And if I could show you, you would never leave it. If I could show you, you would never leave it. And if I could show you, you would never leave it. If I could show you, you would never leave it. And if I could show you, you would never leave it. If I could show you, you would never leave it. And if I could show you, you would never me. I wanna ride a train up my lover's arm, destination the brain. Then climb out and find out what's going on. Cut through trees and ride through rocks. And synchronise the universal sun down to my watch. I've seen a lot, but not quite as much as her. To top it off, the memory and her imagination blurred. But I know she's been put through hell, I can feel it. And I know she's touched heaven as well, tryin to steal it. It came on, it tought her the song. It strung her along and it caught her when that guard was gone. Now to the break of dawn she wants to feel that fix. And all the family and friends is tryin to seal them lips. I'm not dumb, I can hear that train come from miles away. I'm setting obstacles to stop the arrival. I'm gonna blow up that iron and wood road. From what I understood those be the aura fits of her survival. My recital, yet another tantrum. Because she's highly excitable swinging moods at random. No happy endings always off to a bad start. Addictive voyeurism to the trackmarks. "

I\'m sick, sick of waiting in vain, tired of playing the game. Thinking of making a change, finally breaking the chains. Every phase, every happening, craze. When it\'s said and done, my head is right back in a haze. I\'m ready for the next chapter and page to start acting my age. And part ways with Black Thought from back in the days. I\'m stargazing from the back of the stage. Questioning if who y\'all praise is worthy of praise. What\'s the phrase "bygones is bygones?". Niggas who used to be the underdogs is icons. People say the light shines once in a lifetime. Is this midlife kind a crisis a little bit like mine. I\'m thinking not now, but right now. I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now. I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now. The quick and the dead, which one is my lookalike now?. Opportunities lost because I blew them. On the sunniest days of my life, I cry through them. And I would pray to God but I\'m tired of lying to him. Tired of trying to run from the things inside of us. Got a lot of fam, and a lot of admirers. Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed. But when I think of changing, it\'s like why even try this shit?. I know my good and bad deeds both get recorded. You do right so your soul can last. But my role is cast before I even audition for it. So I don\'t really see an end to my vice. It\'s just false reformation, no end of my strife. Feel the evil overpowering, you can go ahead throw the towel in. Cause nigga, that\'s the end of the fight. When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light. Lights out, party over, it\'s the end of your life. When I look into the mirror and see my own image. It feels like there\'s something else far in the distance. Something I wanna see, but something that\'s resistant. And everyday the haunting is growing more persistent. I never noticed it before, but now I can\'t miss it. And the constant pounding is driving me ballistic. I ran from it for years, but it\'s still next to me. And it\'s growing stronger, taking even less of me. I can\'t fight it now, I know it\'s just destiny. And I just wonder what\'s gonna happen when it catches me. Will it leave me face down in the Chesapeake?. Or will it just start bringing out the best in me?. But is the best in me really just the worst in me. And if so, yesterday could be my anniversary. In sinner\'s court, sip port and have church with me. I\'m trying to get rid of these ghosts that\'s cursing me. I\'m feeling change is an absolute certainty. Cause what\'s going on is a state of emergency. '

That try to chase these shots with flavors that ain\'t even as sweet as her. My ambitious girl, I won\'t forget you. I just reflect on how I ain\'t met you, yet boo. You somewhere, getting your life in order. So for this time being, I hope this open scribe might support her. Support her, or work her, she worth it.

Diamonds deserve diamonds, but he convinced me I was worth less. When my peoples would protest. I told them mind their business, cause my shit was complex. More than just the sex.

But I'mma rock it cause my pockets ain't stuffed enough. All the freaks wouldn't speak cause my checks were weak. They would turn the other cheek so I started to seek. A way to get a play, and maybe one day. I'll be performing up a storm for a decent pay. The road ain't yellow and it ain't no witches. I used to stand on the block selling cooked up rock. Money busting out my sock cos I really would clock. They were for kind of fiends bringing jackets and jeans. Magazines, anything, just to hustle up beans. The cash was coming fast, money grew like grass. People hungry for the blast that don't even last. Didn't want to be involved but the money will get ya. Gettin richer and richer, the police took my picture. Money, jewelry. And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car. the town's Al Pacino. Loyal members in a crew now down with the game. Selling nickels and dimes in sunshine or rain. In the first time in my life loaning money to dad. Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches. My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches. A thug will mugs for drugs, he eventually bugs. Looking for crack on carpets and rugs. Cause rags to riches switches men to witches. Become stitches, body bags in ditches. Bloodshed, I painted the town red. People fled as I put a dread's head to bed. That means dead, in other words deceased. Face got erased, bullets got released. Bombs were planted and kids were kidnapped. In fact this was a way to get back. At enemies who tried to clock G's. On my block, now they forever knock Z's. In God we trust. now rots to rust. Bust caps to cops, policeman drops. You blew off his top when the pistol went pop. Troopers, soldiers, rolling like boulders. Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder. Some young male put in jail. His lawyer so good his bail is on sale. Be like John Gotti. and drive a Maserati. Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello. One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate. But just stay, ship him upstate by the Great Lakes. So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand. On his own two feet because now he's in a new land. Rules are different and so is life.

Head coach not amused. Coach seeing red. Coach on the diamond dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him. When he transverse 3rd, the families turn nervous. The following is a transcript of man vs. vermin. Here we go. Man stands out by a hole. Pest pops up to patrol. Man plays live Whack-a-Mole. In a scene that would try every child as adults. Woah.

Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist:. "Ministry live at the Ritz". It was Christ has risen to Chris. 3 loaves, 2 fish. Miracle of mechanized loops on 2-inch. Coming to a theater he would be there in the flesh. Moms didn\'t say "No," but she didn\'t say "Yes". Cop tickets, ah the plot thickens. Countdown to ultimate concert experience. Ma still wary. "...and why are they called Ministry?! Are they a cult?!...". Maybe she would properly investigate. Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview. Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three. That\'s all, no fair trial. Simply, "You will not be going to the show and that\'s final!". What occurred next were the top of the lungs of a son who unjustly had lost what he loved. In a moment that would transcend anger to high art. Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!". Can you even imagine a death in the fam from industrial fandom?. Anyway, no body count no concert and Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse. My older brother is a funny dude. A lot of funny shit happened to him. We hadn\'t spoken in a couple moons. I called him last night. "How you doing?". Just in case of rough waters, I want to put one up for my brothers.

Baby, I\'ve been making plans, oh love. Baby, I\'ve been making plans for you. Baby, I\'ve been making plans. Baby, I\'ve been making plans for you. (My sincerest apologies, I mean it). Look, I\'ll admit it, albeit pathetic. That I\'m in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding. Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well. It?s not your fault they try get me cause I\'mma need the sales. Cause I\'m selfish, and I need you to myself. Tryna see you afloat, but don\'t wanna see you excel. Cause I failed and see you \'bout to cry. I\'m sorry, and you starin\' at my comments. Fearin\' it\'s gone always be you sharin\' me with all them. Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?. Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them. It\'s hard, you know temptation and all. Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship\'s strong. Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart. Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I\'m wrong. But I\'m promisin\' you better though. And your friends sayin\', "let him go". And we ain\'t gettin\' any younger. I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though. (Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote. Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love). I?ll admit it, let me be hypothetic. The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it. The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off. And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss. Brush you off, see I\'m kinda lost. Now I\'m up in the club with a couple of move ons. And dark, good nigga, troubled heart. Went from fallin\' in love to drunk and fallin\' apart. This is hard, tryna find some time to move on. Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark. Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong. My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long. Nah, good terms how that ended. But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business. Off white picket fences, on flights with the children. On site stealin\' kisses on off nights my intentions but. But I plan to do it better though. But you still sayin\' let it go. We ain\'t gettin\' any younger. Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though. We ain\'t nothin\' but some planets. Seinfield: I always feel like I?m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, ?Hey, I think I can jump across.?. '

In the tradition of these legendary sports pros. As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold. Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime. And I'm an icon when I let my light shine. Shine bright as an example of a champion. Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling. Burn like a chariot. always above and beyond average. that I train with and travel with. Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize. I realise I'm supposed to reach for the skies. Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise. [Verse 2: Black Thought]. One love, one game, one desire. One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher. I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired. Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph. It's David and Goliath. Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions. Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans. I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science. It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet. The only thing I hear is my heart. I'm inspired by the challenge. That I find myself standing eye to eye with. Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward. You can't escape the history that you was meant to make. That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take. You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate. There's something in your heart. And it's in your eyes. It's the fire, inside you. Let it burn. "

S'Bangles in my head, shake the song off. Another manic Monday night, its gonna be a long walk. A car pulled up, a fixed up Cutlass. A woman and a child climbed out and left it running. They went inside of the deli, placed an order. With the extra dollar fifty bottled water cause the daughter\'s picky. When they came out mommy gave me a glance. That said man can love an angel but he\'s got to take the chance. Already knew the deal, I lit one up and walked. So they got back in they Oldsmobile, belted up, and took off. Thug love on the corner by the Walgreens. Looking at me like I\'m just another square Saltine. As I get closer I notice they showing each other sketches. Out of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots. . I walk past with a nod and a reminisce. Swear to god hip hop and comic books was my genesis. Respect the life and the fashions of the children. It\'s the only culture I\'ve got, exactly what we\'ve been building. All of a sudden I\'m in front of some man. No, he\'s a young\'un, but he\'s got a gun in his hand. He looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no, he looks afraid. Immediately apprehensive \'til I heard him say. "Do you want this? It\'s not mine, I promise. I found it on my block in between a couple garages. Didn\'t want to leave it for a child to stumble over. I don\'t even know how to hold it". It was a thirty eight, the poor man\'s machete. Held it in my hand, thinking damn man it\'s heavier than expected. Wedged it behind my belt buckle. Knowing that it\'s evil, even thought that I could smell trouble. The extra strength felt weak. But over there on the corner saw what I needed. And proceeded to cross the street. Put the heat in the mail box to lose it. Figured that the post office knows what\'s best to do with it. Mosey down the road, thinking about the old. I used to roam this zone through two feet of snow. Right here, this used to be a record shop. I\'ve gotten love, I\'ve gotten drunk, I\'ve gotten beat up in that parking lot. I\'ve had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades. These alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days. Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave. All the way to the grave. south side is my resting place. Took a right on Lyndale I\'m getting near. But then the road became empty and the people disappeared. The clouds ran away, opened up the sky. And one by one I watched every constellation die. And there I was frozen, standing in my backyard. Face to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star. I should\'ve known, walked all the way home. To find that she wasn\'t here, I was still all alone. No matter where I am, no matter what I do. I\'m always coming back home to you. They can leave me for dead they can take away my true. I\'m always coming back home to you. Through the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew. I\'m always coming back home to you. As sure as the life in the garden that you grew. I\'m always coming back home to you. No matter where I am, no matter what I do. I\'m always coming back home to you. If only I had known what you already knew. I\'m always coming back home to you. From the heaven I\'ve had to the hell I been through. I\'m always coming back home to you. I\'m always coming back home to you. '

My prayers are simple, my forehead is layered with wrinkles. Symbolic Hip Hop prophet speak to your subconscious. Fringe politics got the public thinking the opposite. Elite neo-liberal child of the indigo. Then I implant the arcane image of Saint Germaine. High lyrical exponent intelligence quotient. When I\'m focused I can engage multiple opponents. But I won\'t if, I have no motive, "Soldier be careful, it\'s loaded!". Verbose with emotions of psychosis. A real emcee don\'t have to do what he don\'t wanna do. And that includes freestylin\' in front of you. I\'d rather be broke then be fake and get paid. These layers of physicality challenge me. My soul is gold and it\'s the only thing that\'s able to balance me. My energy body has a alchemical copy that looks godly. Even the American flag says \'Made in China\'. Fathers, mothers, sons, daughters. In the land of the lawless, sacrificed before Horus. The Inca, the Aztecs, the Mayans, were masters. The Shaman pays homage to Solomon. He orders them to send the witchdoctor in, then asked me to rhyme again. Every now and then I get retarded and spit. I would like to apologize to every artist I dissed. Everybody assumes that I wanna rhyme when I don\'t. Sometimes I just wanna chill and watch you flow. Mysteries of the cathedral, the dark overlords are evil. Ripped out the vocal cords of the people. I walk up to your bed side in disguise with red eyes. '

From the roof I watch the street. And pray for those that's caught beneath. As long as I know right from wrong. I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs. Wake me up when it's time to make babies. I wanna lift every yellowbrick. I've never felt pressure to have to justify my selfishness. At least not to you and yours. Maybe just my friends and fellowships. As long as the mood is somehow linked to my enhanced development. I swear they'll understand!!!. There's a storm outside my tenement. Beats upon my windows with Mother Nature's adrenaline. Blockhead. stays glued to the television. Now I look less intelligent. Cuz I'm the one that tried to bear the elements and lost. Well it's warm by the filament. Huddled up close in the company of all my relatives. Stories, laughs, black coffee and honest-to-God sentiment. Cocooned inside the unified efforts to all get settled in. Away from where the rain pours!. Well count your delegates. Weed out the bums who practice migration other than elegant. Of course I realize the filtering procedure's delicate. But let devils inside to collide with your overzealousness. And fall to rock bottom. Spot 'em with their carelessness. The urge could burst to turn even those pacifist to militant. You can't even have half of free second. To become jealous in. You gotta aim, fire and aspire to be model veteran. Buried in merit badges. I'm stuck in the center and could care less. About the eye of the storm and its monstrous measurements. I got a defense that I call coolin' with my brethren. Sometimes I get wet. But it's better than risking life and limb to me, don't you agree?. If you wanna push. Then I'm ready to push. But if you pulling while I'm pushin'. Then why did you ask me to push?. "

S'I feel weathered, but feel like I\'ve been driving forever. Showin\' up to rock show or trying to hold myself together. I\'ve been better, but all things pass. This life is taking everything away but you\'re provided with your past. So fuck it--I stick to having dreams on the road. But until this dream is done I\'m gonna keep my eyes closed. And breathe, breathe when it snows. Breathe when I\'m forced to live a life with a person on a phone. Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin\'. I can make this all better when I close my eyes. I\'m in another zone where troubles gone. A place where life is easy for everybody else. I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself. I\'m in another space where all the food is good. And there\'s enough for everybody in my neighborhood. Where all the grass is blue, where we don\'t know \'bout green. Cause money ain\'t a thing I pinch myself it\'s not a dream. Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems. If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldn\'t mean a thing. Between climbing and finding it not worth it. I\'m so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind. I think of home when I close my eyes. So done with the smokes and fries. Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life. Drinks I shouldn\'t drink, things I never write. Cities I never liked now it\'s like aight. Got merch table weirdos, bros who want to cypher. Girls who want to fuck, but not vice versa. My work is love no complaints I\'m fine. Its been a long night can\'t wait to close my eyes. I dream of an industry ego-less. And free from the modern chains with these chains we\'re so deep in love. Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up. Dreaming a publicist wasn\'t 2 G\'s a month. And where it\'s not about numbers and math. And I was content with really just a couple of fans. And my happiness wasn\'t relying on tours and a van. Merch sales, iTunes, MySpace and a band. With the front, front row stadium packed. And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back. And scream at them "Look at me now, look at me man". Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track. Wide awake in the rap game, but life I\'m asleep. '

I\'m merely a vessel that the entity chooses to use. I\'m raw energy, just like you. I don\'t teach cause Teachers only receive contempt from the youth. The poetry\'s fairly simple, you perceive the visual. The grass isn\'t greener, it\'s browner. You say, "You don\'t like the album", I say you a coward. You say you don\'t like the beats, I say what about them?. We are all equal; we are all sisters and brothers. In spite of our colour, all we have is each other, they love us. Your sexual orientation is none of my business. But don\'t lie to yourself, and don\'t lie to the children. Some of us are healthy, some of us have diseases. But if you look at the whole world we represent the human species. You can\'t ignore continents while they starve. You\'ll be wearin\' their shoes before long.

Don\'t believe that we deserve another chance and I\'ll tell you why. We watch each other die, and we\'re still racist. Not in my household, but in other places. The patience of the Gods have run thin. Because of your sin, the period of purification will begin. The procession will wash away. The world\'s sins with Tsunami\'s and Whirlwinds. Our world ends, but then it begins again. Six-thousand four-hundred eighty years later. The next civilization will dig our artifacts out of a crater. They will say that we were great but that they are greater. I believe the Cosmonauts will come down and save us. If humankind will accept all races. There\'s no reason that the Cosmonauts wouldn\'t save us. Love your neighbours; we\'re different, but God made us. Love all races, the Cosmonauts would love to save us. Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth (B.I.B.L.E.). Wake up, stop the hatred, the Cosmonauts wanna save us. '

I claim this region to hundred-mile radius. Twin Cities' flavors Rhymesayers got the tastiest. And you can hate me, it's part of the territory. As long as you know it's impossible to ignore me. From middle fingers to hugs, tofu to the drugs. The fight fists, might as well just take pictures of Slug. And live out your own life to the fullest. Why you starin' at my feet when you're standin' in this bullshit?. You could never learn how to ride a bike without balance. So what's the point of trying to grab the mic without talents. Go get your brakes looked at, you fucking fake hood rat. Wanna be the basement's greatest? Too late, already took that!. Father knows best, but Father knows stress. But Father needs love, a back rub, and some rest. Damn he could use a good home cooked meal. Been burnin' both ends since he broke the seal. Up, up and away, watch him take off. Give himself a little hell and quit the day job. And ignite the sunlight, tryin' to write about life. About face, break the fear, and you're here till the plight. And I wish that I had something to say. That could wipe that smile right off of your face. Here take my hand pretend you know my name. And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game. Cats be walkin' into the spot like they own it. Wearin' a face that they should save for they opponents. With the shoelaces tied, yet too wasted to drive. Either way I've arrived to bless this place with my vibe. Yeah right, my vibe ain't even cool. I sit in the corner and drink until I slur and drool. The t-shirt says shoot pool, not people. Kill time, not life, grab the mic and let the beat go. (Beat go beat go beat go). But that's good for me. It's hard to hide a magic card when you wear a short sleeve. Force feed what I've got when they not hungry. Tryin' to replace everything that they ripped off from me. Bloke the tummy, and choke the dummy theory. Beat the point dead until these folks hear me clearly. Keep it all simple, a simplistic intricate. Rebuild the robots with bigger tits and little fists. Repo man, a world full of slow jams. Grab the prize and clutch it tight with both hands. Why go to serve tall talk?. Anyone that calls this fall off can suck my balls off. I ain't goin' nowhere, I'm still here, right here. Same spot that I stood when you first woke up. The same guy that grabbed the mic and made your girl wanna fuck. The same MC still runnin' on an empty tank of luck. And I wish that I had something to say. That could wipe that smile right off of your face. Here take my hand, pretend you know my name. And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game. And I wish that I had something to say. That could wipe that smile right off of your face. Come here take my hand, pretend you know..know..know.

Unlike the other drugs where you had control. This substance had engulfed your body and soul. Now from me you lost all respect. Said yo need to put that shit in check. Wanted me to believe that you had tried. But your mind and the craving had coincided. Said there was a voice inside you that talked. Which said you shouldn't stop but continue to walk. Now the brother who could handle any drug. Had just found the one that could pull his Plug. (Ya don't stop, ya don't, ya don't stop). (Ya don't stop, the body rock). Remember that day?

He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop. Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock. I had a connect to cross-sales, to catch more mill's. Than ho-bitches got birth control pills. I'm in the park setting up a deal over blunt fire. Bum nigga sleeping on the bench, they had him wired. Peeped my convo, the address of my condo. And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe. And while we set up camp, we got vamped. Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart. Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee. Blown out the frame like Pan Am Flight 103.

Plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick. His Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors. Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars. Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt. For instance, chop off hands, attack worth. His idols would lock down airports and extort. Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort. Up in the ski resorts, up in hills. They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles. The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers. And live large and bigger than my nigga. Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room. She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb. Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors. And still organizes crime and drug wars. [Hook 3: GZA]. Fiends ain't coming fast enough. There is no cut that's pure enough. I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload.

And thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me. Seen our love, is never gonna find me. And I keep looking, oh, for that brighter day. Oh and I got to talk, to keep myself together. But all I see is stormy weather. Now I got to get, get myself together. Cuz I can't take no more, of this stormy weather. Night falls and I call for you, love. But there's no one there but my reflection. "

No longer a couple like two in one skin. Where do you end and where do I begin. Both brains become one mind sensually. Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity. With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve. Longing for the love of all the other nevers. As they writhe and twist in satisfaction. In the burning chill of pleasure we bathe. Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave. Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction. But of creation, elation in the re-making.

Let some slug into your life. Suddenly she hypes an eyebrow up, like. "What do you mean?" and I start bugging like. "If I was to follow you home would you keep me. Would you feed me, would you pet me. Would I fuck you till you\'re sleepy?". She said I\'m creepy, and walked off. Too late, I already got off on the fact you even stopped. You knew I\'d treat you like an object. You knew I was a rapper, you knew it was the trend. For us rapper men to disrespect women in front of friends. Nonetheless; here comes that kid Sean that I used to be cool with. Went to school with, now this kid is talking fool shit. Getting supper touchy with his lips about. How I stuck his bitch supposedly. What the fuck is this supposed to be. Sean\'s got nuts, he\'s alone, I\'m with crew. Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do. I spew. Look here, this makes believers of cartoons. And I happen to know your bitch sleeps in until the afternoon. Honestly, my man, you don\'t bother me. Cause Everybody bleeds, now go and ask your seed who his father be. [Hook].

Shit gets done like that in the world of rap. If they pushing on ya vibe, you just a pussy if it slides. So I sprint up three flights, didn\'t do the feet wipe at the door. Dragging dirt and blood on the rug, and the wood floor. Couldn\'t believe my squad just stood there and watched. Word to God, Spawn is telling me to blame it on my cock. I\'m amped, and I\'mma shoot every motherfucker out there. I\'m ill, and I\'m gonna prove that shit when I get back downstairs. Into the bedroom, my passion aimed at the closet. Visualizing the top shelf, that\'s where the shoebox is. I push the top up, enough to fit my hand in. Reach into the box in a frenzy, realizing that it\'s empty. Hand rests in the box, head festers in an open stun. Then I remember, I don\'t even own a gun. [Hook]. "What, What" (I\'m like) "What Kid What". I\'m like "What, What" (I\'m like) "What Kid What".

S'you\'re gonna play in the dark, like when it rains in the park. You\'re hardly conscious of the stains and scars. enabling your partly clouded logic. To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates. Now, you\'re working yourself out the same as when you strain\' with a nautilus. And you\'re willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence. If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense. Then, do you really regret when you\'ve shredded your promises?. Now, I\'ve tested the waters, kid. Sipped it; rippled the pond a bit. Visits have been abolished,. and this shit\'s killing my confidence. Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment?. If you miss chicks when they\'re around, the phrase "Let\'s quit" isn\'t an option. You best fix whatever\'s wrong and just move on and get on with it. You\'ll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it. It\'s sad, but proud or not, most your standards go down a notch. When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high. Cause, It isn\'t really my time, is it? Shit, I just found the watch. But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day, has me fearing my grandfather clock. And I can\'t die without trying. my hands tied in knots. Knowing that I\'ll never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks. Love is hampered by thought, if you can handle the prospect of. Death - it\'s as massive a shock. And to intellects, it\'s a fuckin\' smack in the crotch. It\'s a cancer that rots your soul, tosses demons off of the road. Just use caution and know, that, love ain\'t nothing but a loss of control. Off then, we go. [Hook]. Love\'ll have you nervous, doing stupid shit on purpose. Brain out of service, words slurred when you blurt shit. Studderin\', utterin\' non-sensical shit in your verses. Feeling like a shirtless four-breasted woman in a circus. Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void. Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy. So girls create a false world of filling on boys. Exploited, guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys. But when you have it, there\'s nothing like it, you get excited. Seeking those who provide it, on phones talking to psychics. Some fear it, spend their entire lives trying to fight it. Living in a confusing Hayes, like they\'re grooving to Isaac. It ain\'t the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map. It ain\'t easily learnable with definitions in tact. It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks. Hittin\' and bullwhippin you, leavin\' them slits in your back. But I\'ve been a lucky one, loving parents, loving friends. But I still spend alot of my life loving sin. But I ain\'t a genius on it, I can only pretend. Cause over all it\'s an emotion I cannot comprehend. It\'s love. Love ain\'t the basis for action. In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction. Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion. Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction. And the past isn\'t felt as a match made in hell. But rather its held as a latter day meld. Of common mistakes and nice intentions. But when false love retention is simply vice invention. It\'s only right to mention the fights you get in. Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions. So what\'s love really got to do with it?. From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens. The truth isn\'t as eloquent so be intelligent. Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of it\'s irrelevant. Now live your life for the love or stop. '

S'Divide my senses by six and you\'ll end up with triple sixes. And triple the digits mean triple the spirits. My light body to the third power will triple my lyrics. I\'m triple the threat, I\'m triple my physical flesh. I\'m telling you, put your money on me then triple your bet. ?Cause I won\'t be satisfied ?til I\'m set. ?Till I got a triplex out in Tribeca with the skyline effect. Rhyming is the nine-to-five that I manipulate best. Eight hours of writing and memorizing a manuscript. Called "The Biography of Canibus". Subtitled ?The Ultimate Guide for Teaching Modern Man How to Spit\'. I\'m wicked with this, I should be selling tickets to this. Paparazzi should probably be taking pictures of this. Saying, "We want ?Bis! We want ?Bis!. We want the rapper with the illest lyrics!". I can go four quarters or nine innings for this. Go twelve rounds, play two days of cricket for this. Lead crusades across Europe like the Christians for this. My rhymes are out of this world like the Russian space-station. Sneak-attack rappers, grab them and slash them. Chop their heads off with claws sharper than velociraptors. Hunt them like Jurassic Park actors. Action packed like Shaft, the black assassin. Do not follow me these madmen, popping ecstasy pills like aspirin. Drink a gallon of cyanide and still can not die. Beat your ass like Lennox Lewis did to David Tua. In front of a hundred-million pay-per-viewers your career is ruined. Your face will be swollen like the Benihana Buddha. Beyond the length of this rhyme you have no future. Hypnotize the audience you perform in front of to start booing. Put your mic down and step away from it. Shut your mother fucking mouth and don\'t say nothing. You have the right to remain silent. Sentenced to life on Rikers Island for terrible freestyling. I heard a rumour English women make love the best. Is that true? ?Cause I ain\'t had no justice yet. A lot of clowns keep arguing on who the best is. Bite the style but can\'t digest it. ?Til they get karate kicked in the mouth and their teeth get ejected. Told you to ?Watch Who U Beef Wit\' on the last record. Put it down in the east, put it down in the west. It\'s like Pak-Man don\'t stop. ?Til I hear my voice banging up and down the block. I guess you can\'t write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind. '

S'I prefer your applause without a handout. So refrain from the clap like a Prophylac. Touring through the warmest cities with the coldest raps. Rolling with the dopest hoes and they don\'t know I rap. I still be splitting women like a bogus hocus-pocus act. Smell the folgers get the scrotum out your focus. I can\'t drink what niggas serving, there\'s no wonder why I po\' it. It\'s no wonder why I go in any hood like I am knowing. \'Cuz they love you when you real, they just like you when your flowing. And they like when I influence, and so perfectly, I do it. So check my net worth, and I got them jerseys moving. Word to Shawn Corey, and you know what I am doing. Got a movement for these niggas, God bless who\'s not into it. Nigga, lyrically gifted, second to only religious scriptures. Ripley\'s Believe it Or Not would tell you that I\'m different. Lift up your seat and just stop, or did you think I would flop?. Go take the "p" out, put a "w", you\'ll see what I got. I make the scene I\'ll make sense, I make ? a lot. I\'m feeling like the realest little nigga in this business. Real enough to admit I listen to people\'s opinions. I\'m tough enough to dismiss \'em, but real enough to petition. Dependent on if it\'s hatred or an objective opinion. I respectfully tell \'em, "I get it, you just don\'t feel it". You just don\'t like what I\'m doing, the lyrics Twitter my image. I ain\'t bitter my nigga, I respect your position. Fuck what they selling, it\'s reality living in the mirror. Temporary the richest, legendary\'s forever. Just remember I said it, by the end of November. '

S"S.I. land. The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop. That was somethin', I had identified with. So I, made it my point to exploit this fly gift then. Myself and RZA, made trips to the B.X. A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex. We knew we would get a reward for the price we'll pay. The basic training was beyond entertainment. Just the caters of the verbal expressions, self explainin'. Wore my boots out in constant walks across the borough. Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough. From well concealed firing positions we let off the most. slang that just shatter the coast. They say I rhyme like the bank that stop. Cause M.C.'s be more shook then the dice that drop. Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven. Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'. They say the product is good. We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood. 'Til it's understood. We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks. At times we play legendary battles on tapes. Since the competition already slayed them in a scrimmage. He continued tarnish that, already faded image. Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em. Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom. This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game. The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder. Strike like the perfect bowler. brought to a level where you froze and can't speak. Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak. "

S'Where me and my nigga rode the Marta, through the hood. Just tryna find that hook up. Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling. Watching ceiling fans go \'round, tryna catch that feeling. Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper. We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur. Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light. Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock. Doing the hole in the wall clubs. This shit here must stop, like "Freeze!". We making the crowd move, but we not making no G\'s. And that\'s a no-no. Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac. They call us. went from Player\'s Ball to ballers. Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging. Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals. Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry. "OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise". Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly. \'96 gon\' be that year that all y\'all playa haters can bite me, I\'m out this bitch. Me and you. Your momma and your cousin too. Rolling down the strip on Vogues. Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors. Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger. Looking to fill me belly with that Rally\'s bullshit. Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled. Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys. Smoking them white girls,. before them blunts, got crunk, chunky asses. Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary\'s. And they looking like Halle Berry\'s. So so fine. and I\'m so high. Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug. And my little brother James,. thangs changed in the hood. Where I live at, them rats know. "Momma I want to sing. But momma I want to trick, and momma I\'m sucking dick now". We moving on up in the world like elevators. Me and the crew,. we pimps like \'82,. me and you like Tony Toni Tone. (Like this, East Point and we gone). Got stopped at the mall the other day. Heard a call from the other way that I just came from. Some nigga was saying something, talking \'bout smoke something "Hey man, you remember me from school?" "No not really". But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly. And he kept asking me, "What kinda car you drive?. I know you paid, I know y\'all got beaucoup billfolds. From all them songs that y\'all done made". And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had. True, I\'ve got more fans than the average man. But not enough loot to last me. To the end of the week. I live by the beat. Like you live check-to-check. If you don\'t move your feet then I don\'t eat. So we like neck-to-neck. Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes. From Virginia, this ain\'t gon\' stop, so we just gon\' continue. '

S"Bat-shit crazy, I feel like Hip Hop hate me. They erased me & my sanity escaped me. The logo was branded on the back of the savage. She and I stand before a rabbi in dark fabric. The best man is a jealous scumbag maggot. He's also her best friend who pretends to be a faggot. I'm Hannibal Lecter. Coronating metaphors with my sword and scepter. I was never the best, just corrupted by the weight of success. Could've been more productive with less breath. I translate codes, animate ones and zeroes. To sideways 8 'til something great unfolds. Stingray sharp barbed darts launch from the heart of the Sephiroth sloth. That can make you bleed thoughts. So be advised, my rhymes override the mind. But you'll be fine after average recovery time. My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones. The bow is quietly cocked, watch, I'm a take the shot. If the target ever stands in one spot. Tentacles form a loose noose, hang your ass off of the roof. Suffocate you 'til you mourn for a truce. Introduce you to my people, stick you with some needles. Then place you in a bathtub of carrion beetles. Go to sleep people, I'll watch why they feed off your evil. "

Talking hella proper like reading a teleprompter. Long ass legs looking fly as a helicopter. bad news was sent. Not a Hollywood divorce but a bluegrass split and she went. Ayo I met her on the corner of Abbot Kinney and Venice. She said her life was a movie and finding me was the premise. Sex like a drug, she played the role of a chemist. Supplying me with a feeling I never thought I could fathom. Cupid shot me right in the chest with his golden handgun point blank. Joint full of dank in my left palm.

S"Well known on the scene. jail bait queen. Had the first baby, barely eighteen. Father of the child was after one thing. When the daughter came, the dad was unseen. It don't matter, he ain't got a job. Second shift till the neck is stiff. But she worked to build her own nest to live. Soon after that baby's dad slash lazy bum with no cash. He want to come over and crash. He want to play his part. So she let him move into that garden level apartment. She knew better, she did it anyways. Explain better when you trynna see some better days. The suns up, catch those rays. But she still dreams after she woke. Tight hold on that hope. Sometimes it could seem so cold do what you gotta do to cope. Two years later, two months pregnant. Same daddy, same broke ass situation. This time the doc said her heart might break. Praise God that the job got her health benefits straight. She believes in the right to choice. But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy. Makes more now a days on the day shift. Balanced that with night classes, take some. Time and space and make it all fit. The apartment they now live in is overcrowded. Raised her voice and made her point. Told that boy, go get employed. He put on his best shirt. Said he wasn't comin back till he gets work. She knew what that part meant. So she swept every piece out that apartment. Peace out, keep out, take the scenic route. Rather only have to feed three mouths. She adapts to everything now. A little girl was her first reason to breathe. And a little man was the first man she believed in. She gotta live right and do right by self. She do for self, she don't want your help. Afraid of bein alone, but fear ain't enough to knock her off of that stone. Gonna make that home her home, with or without a man that she could call her own. Big boss at work is anxious, continues to hand her the wrong advances. She passes the test, she knew the answers. Quit the job to go take her chance with life. This is life, we all strain. While we pray for dollars and we work for change. It's all the same, we all struggle. Sometimes you gotta say fuck you!. When you smile and she doesn't return it. Give her room, man, don't disturb it. If it makes it hurt less to curse and fight. Go ahead and hate the world, girl, you earned the right. "

S"Ay though I love you hate that bitch that's always with you. A Shame I gotta put up with her shit just to get you. She threw another fit you had to split because she was wit you. And now I'm at the crib all alone damn I miss you. Ay when we first met you was too tense for me to get through. And then I got you loose it's like a glove how I fit you. Your two lips they smell like tulips so official. My niggas'll probably clown me if I told 'em that I kissed you. But you clean as a whistle wet as a tissue in the toilet. Love to hit that spot get you hot like I boil it. Even let ol' girl watch she enjoy it. Even though she make it hard for me to see you. Knowing that I need you. Now look, don't make a grown nigga beg that ain't fair bitch. oh look you got your hair did. For me looks good she said oh you so sweet. Now get me while you can you bout to have to wait a whole week. Ah hell not the beast really I don't give a fuck. Well since you already bleedin' that mean I don't get to cut. Ay look I'm already fienin' so just let me slide thru. Tell your homegirl relax and let me get inside you. Because that booty mad thick behind your juicy ass lips. I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit. Then I'm bustin' like an uzi in this bougie ass chick. The only reason that I put up with this moody ass bitch. Is... you. She said I love you she talks tellin' me to kiss her up. But when her friend visits I doesn't get it much. Its soo-woo season and shawty dick teasin' now for that reason. Now my shit is like a crip sneaker. Listen love of my life, I'm tryin' to get some, a-. -ttention. You don't gotta listen just give a fuck. Your mouth, I don't need, your legs, you can keep. Just tryin' to get up in your jeans re-sew your seams. And your pussy was the cameo but stole the scene. So I got my camera on your cameltoe say cheese. Two lips blowin' kisses, muah to my mistress. Goodbye to my girl when I'm in it. I'll take you out shorty but let me know its mine. I'll paint you with my tongue and stay in those bikini lines. See it's a part of you I gotta be a part of. But every other part of you make me wanna depart and. Baby look at what you started, why am I working for it. Why are we still conversing when I'm sure you've heard the chorus. I'm sure you get the point and I prefer you throw it urgent. Your mind can say no but she can't control the urges. Because your booty mad thick behind them juicy ass lips. Trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit. Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm through with that shit. The only reason why I put up with this stupid ass bitch. Is because of you. Uh, and how I wish I would've met you first. Never had a chance to try. Cause your overprotective friend saw the lust in my eyes. So you she would hide cause she thought of me as a typical guy. Which you know I'm different, right. You listenin' to her is leaving you with empty nights. Recognize shawty, be real with ya'self. Mama feelin' herself literally. And I wondering if her mission is to get rid of me. Cause every time you come by to kick it. And I open up the door you bring her cranky ass with you. Influencing your decisions I can't even get a minute. Without her making attempts to garner all of my attention. She talk and I don't listen, I'm just picturin' me stickin'. And movin' you moanin', music on the counter in the kitchen. Spitta be that nigga bitches reachin' for my zipper. Cause they figure that's the way to my digits I beg to differ. Lifted like the research group, I so get it. She know you'll never be the same if I hit it. You know you longing for the stroke so you drippin'. She smoking and that'll be the scapegoat for slippin'. bougie. Is... you. "

And it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage. I got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle. And my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel. Then I settle in a stand still. I live forever reaching for the sun. Hoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a handful. Rope ladder,. I'm a swinging anvil. And I wanna turn skullies and tummies with pretty lullaby, bye. The way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal. I never felt so damn young. But you don't look a day over zero. And you don't look a day in its eyes cuz it'll make you realize. The night is near so. Well then go, dream, I clean around the edges. I tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges. I never really knew the true definition of precious. Till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave me the message. I'm a fully animated life tree. See the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song. Of I'm a fully animated life tree. With branches for the heavens to admire naturally. Fame, war, love, honor, crime, innocence, tragedy, sunshine. Cringe, death, passion, heroism, God, suffering, joy, fate. Destiny, treasure, stars, gall, hunger, murder, silence, mayhem. Health, pain, suspense, breath, sound, guilt, pride, time. We all know what a halo is. But we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips. I be the matador making your pretty little heels click. I be the Sword in the Stone. of the contemporary eclipse. I'm incredibly exhausted. You can't imagine, got my warm spirit stuck in my teeth, I'm obsolete. Freedom freedom freedom fighter beginning. For the sake of better demeanor and such to bust, fucking fantastic. Every little step she takes breaks the chambers. In the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble. Settle for a cruel second, loud for an hour. Screamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour. I ain't been around the world but I been around the block. I ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk. I ain't a prophet, I ain't the Second Coming of Christ. I'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice. I wanna weave a web, I bought a set of knitting needles. Fiddling with a theme, dream solid. Paddle in the hole-in-the-bottom dingy to where the portraits astonish. You won't regret a single solitary step, I promise. Look, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate. I make a true spur of the moment grown decision. Which in turn allows me to be something normal. With the prefix of the 'ab' and. I can kill every monster if I gotta, that's that. Rockin' it, rockin' it, clippership rockin' it. Be the little guinea pig, dig?. I'm tryin to make an exit with no ripples in the water. No splash, let the poison slide down down the hatch. It's like that. "

Or shall I call them second rhymes - written seconds \'fore you enter the booth. Words thrown together with very little truth. And a select few can do it (true) you ain\'t part of them scriptures. Ladies and gentlemen, introducin Workmatic. One of L.I.\'s finest, and this is "MY LIFE". Which is filled with bad minutes and good hours. And, good months and bad years and with my peers. We struggle to juggle the shit. Family life and the music game don\'t easily fit. My lady wants me home, sayin rap tour three rap whores. And scores of scandal, even more than we can handle. Sometimes, the rhymes I say. Is the fly the currency to save the day. Can\'t turn it away, cause we out. To find presennce way beyond our measure, so baby don\'t pout. '

I've killed off every damsel that I know. For castles that I keep, castles that I know. [Hook]. I'm having spirits in the dark, laying under moonlight. Laughing with a stranger, like I saved her from her doomed life. Pop a couple Percs. Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy. A path that I rehearse, a cycle on repeat. Life is like a lion and I'm dying at its feet. I roll another sweet, check my muted Treo. I've seen them as the plot, too busy caught up in the B-roll. My eye up to the keyhole, scared to turn the knob. And go out on my own,. My memory bank's the only thing I tend to rob. And every time I phone the lob, I'm out of dodge. It's hard, on the boulevard, and other clich?s. The type of bullshit that I'm feeding self these days. Corrosion on my relays. one thing my mirrors chose. An imp in new clothes, exposed. I mow a dead lawn, aim for the alpha. Ten claws deck the halls of Valhalla. Not a man, a receptacle for crest-fallen matter. Never tempered or pressed into patterns. But just won't die, instead a palpitation from the plasma. Pumping disenchanting anecdotes and antiquated data at 'em. I get these headaches that climb down into my stomach. Then off into my extremities and out into the public. In a flood of shadow puppetry, something in the air. Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self-aware. It's recognizing family and alphanumeric characters. Scenery and. deities with unassuming avatars. Close encounters exacerbate his condition. From classy to a bastion of classic misdirection. Tune into the Casio adventures. When the rest of me can barely form a god-damn sentence. "

It's little so little that I will belittle your mind. Signed and delivered. Egyptologist wisdom. Hip-hop holy man submerging you all in my baptism. Slap rhythms into newborns.

And don\'t insult me, I won\'t insult you. ?Cause you don\'t know what I will or I won\'t do. Make no mistake, I\'m the Golden State heavyweight. Being underrated gave me time to create. Can you relate? . I renovate, straight out the gate. Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin\' but hate. Millionaires snatching crumbs off my little son plate. Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face. No hoes, no clothes, no one showin\' up for my shows. You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home. But my baby mama hate my guts and can\'t stand me. Packed up, moved out, started a new family. So all this strugglin\' for what, so I can blow up?. Marry a slut but can\'t watch my seed grow up?. Fuck that! This the fucking thanks I get. edutain. Yo, I feel like my whole life is upside down. ?Cause you seeing more support than I\'m seeing my child. It\'s like, every day I wake up, another drama. It\'s a wonder I\'m alive, surviving this karma. If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer. I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her. Without these cameras in our faces like animals. For your Channel 2 Action News. To follow our ambulance up the avenue. And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts, . and what we do in private, since they won\'t let us put up a fence. And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun. Whether it\'s unloaded, full or an unregistered one. No bullets? You\'re so full of shit. This clip is so full, it\'ll spit if I don\'t pull it. And don\'t give me no bullshit, I\'m not in the mood. I just got in a feud in some parking lot with a dude. Over Kim, and she just slit both of her wrists over this shit. Don\'t tell me \'bout the show business shit. I know what this is, bitch. This ain\'t business, this is personal, bitch. You don\'t know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed. I had a very fucked up day, I\'m needing this fifth. Shutting motherfuckers up like they pleadin\' the fifth. Yo, Em, it\'s time to get serious with it. Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet. This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs. Ain\'t no neighborhood that\'s big enough to bang on us. Ain\'t no love lost, my niggas, relax yourself. I\'m about to snatch it all and start spreading the wealth. To my niggas who never seen it, I mean it when I holla. At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones. Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel. Changing your channel, you played like a fucking piano. Riding slow through Cali like I\'m riding a camel. I feel like Tony Soprano; who do I trust now?. tele\'. Spit lines to split spines, just to get mine. Big behind bitches getting dick to spit shine. Sniff lines of coke ? that\'s the only shit that make you dope. Bitch-ass nigga that\'s droppin\' the soap. Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip. And turn till you motherfuckers tell me the right shit. So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself. A front door with twelve locks. And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox. And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?. Fuck that! I protect myself with these twelve shots. And one in the chamber, gun in the waist. And one in the ankle, waitin\' for someone to come to my place. Tryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not. Gonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face. And it\'s a disgrace Hailie can\'t play with her toys. In the front yard, without you drivin\' by, honkin\' your horn. Screamin\' some shit, leanin\' out your windows, beepin\' and shit . or pullin\' up in my drive like I won\'t leap in your whip. And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live. So my address ends up on the Internet again. So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin\' them that if someone comes to my crib, I\'mma shove a gun in their ribs. And reporters blow it out of proportion. Oh, now he\'s pullin\' guns on his fans. Just for tryin\' to stand on his porch. And I\'m the bad guy, ?cause I don\'t answer my door like. "Hey, hi! You guys wants some autographs?. Okay, form a straight line!". Sometimes I feel like loading this rifle, and climbin\' the roof at night and hidin\' outside to snipe you. It\'s not that I don\'t like you; it\'s just that when I\'m not behind the mic, I\'m a person who\'s just like you. '

Welcome to the city, ain't no sympathy for rats. Where the whites move first and you go second, cause you're black. Was it Rayful, was it Reagan, did the 80's hold 'em back?. This is no connect four but blood spilling for connects. Years later niggas still up in that trap. Thank God that a nigga had that rap. Cause after school, played that corner like a rook. That's when niggas getting book, out there tryna get their last move. He gon' need that check mate. And every night they take L's straight to the face. In the grand scheme of life we like pieces on the board. Look inside yours, you a king, or a pawn?. Now for that juice, would you bishop, double cross?. See they move so many squares,  Damier falling off. Now move along, pawns never get the Queens. I'm the only nigga here like Ron Simmons in the ring. Bob Fisher. Genius, me, fresh no Esteban.

I got my alibi straight. and I pulled over to the right. The cop knocked on my window and said "Boy, where\'s the fire?. "Outta the car longhair!". Making like a DT. driving a grand fury. Wherever I hang my hat\'s my home. Every dog has his day. Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis. With his 5 o\'clock shadow. My man turned to me and said, "Why are you here?". I\'m phony-paper passing at Nix Check Cashing. I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn house of D. Houdini\'d out the cuffs,. kicked the screw in the knee. I took the Bailiff\'s wallet. and went straight to OTB. I had a good feeling easy come easy go. I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show. And sure enough, that nag came in.

Genocide in East Africa, but you watching Battlestar Gallactica. Filling up the data in the back of your digital camera. Taking glamorous shots of your mammaries. Surrounded by Vanity Fair magazine. And stuffed animals in the house your parents paid for. Built by hand on land people slaved for. Get ignorant, stay ignorant, in fact. Get belligerent--. If you feel my sentiment, attack. Keep kicking it, screaming for your sense of entitlement. Flip me off with the same hand you hold the Bible with. All that botox, every cream, every vitamin.

S'What would it take to make a woman like you. View a wolf like me for what I really might be. Listening to lyrics only hears what I allow. You gotta try and make me testify for here and right now. Let\'s have a confrontation over a cold one. I\'ll give you conversation just to see if you can hold \'em. I play so dumb. Because I know some of these star-struck small talk art fucks is no fun. I\'m the blood type that goes straight for the guns. Like before you even spoke already knew what your love\'s like. So what you thinking?. Because I\'m thinking we should jump into your ocean. Let\'s go girl, this ship is sinking. Now there\'s no reason to lie, I\'ve had a lot of lovers. In my reality, it\'s impossible to avoid it. But there\'s one reason for life: gotta provide some supper. Gonna build a family just to watch someone destroy it. Do you really think you really wanna get to know me better?. Don\'t you see the drama?. Don\'t you feel the pressure?. Don\'t get me wrong, it would be my pleasure. To sing a song that could remove your shoes and your sweater. Bartender, let me get a shot of Beam. Cause this girl over here is trying to get me out my jeans. And she doesn\'t seem to believe I\'m just another thief. Came to take a piece and make you stutter when you breathe. Now girl you too smart to be a tour mark. Set to play correct from the start with your pure heart. And when you\'re all alone, I\'ll sing into your phone. If you don\'t know the words you can make up your own. The first time she met the devil was at First Avenue. Went backstage with him into the dressing room. Sexy ego trip, taller than expected. About six foot three. Seemed to thrive on his misery. Critical, observant, big words. Sweaty hair, sunken eyes, and thick nerves. She said "I\'ll make him smile for the simple fact that he needs it. I\'ll make him smile just so I can kill it, and eat it". You look like you were built for me. You talk like you want to steal my drink. You kiss like you already came. And that\'s a "Lifter Puller" line for those without any game. It\'s like damn baby. You know you can\'t save me. But you should still tell your people that you\'re leaving with the band. Maybe you can show me your hustle. Neither one of us would be so lonely. If only you would come over here and hold me. I caught you trying to hide your smile behind your glass. But all of your secrets become a swing set when you laugh. And all of your regrets that you\'re carrying or burying. Don\'t mean a damn thing if there\'s nobody to share them with. We\'ve been following each other all night now. We ought to be all over each other like right now. I don\'t like crowds, let\'s take flight now. Cause that face that you make. Reminds me of my life now. '

I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home. The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home. And all I got in return was a darn country song. This whole country wrong. what would you write. If you just put a little ice on and cut your mic on. But you don't even write songs. but Hollywood. Make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra. I'm so not sober. I'm high like a Hollywood. Coffee or soda. you can call me a roller. hold up. Your grill's glistenin'. spent a hundred thousand. On mine to feel different what's the real sense of it?. Bling bling, I know and did you know. I'm the creator of the term I just straightened the perm. Ain't let it sit too long, they just makin it burn. And make a movie of our lifestyle. but they earn. Like a dead body burned on a mantlepiece. That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease. And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze. Defrost on your window pane. Lil Wayne. But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne. it don't make me none. So that's why I got a pre-nup. I do. A is for Adamsville. B is Bowen Homes. See. if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't. If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone. If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song. D is for what I serve. , I don't be on no curb. She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer. But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack. Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act. Now that I've got your undivided attention I'm. Gonna say this and run under condition one. Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball. Promise me you'll invest three fourths of it all. For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese. Cause wealth is the word. Rich is round the corner from the curb. Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird. Antwon Patton and Andre Benjamin. Been jammin. journalists. That's quick to misprint public and private business. Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed. Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet. M&M's with no nuts. Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made. Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt. I do, love you but you hate me at the same time. Lights, camera, action, it's game time. Do you take this here as your lovely wife?. To love her and cherish her for all your life?. I solemnly swear to dare share take you there. And me and you together baby we a lucky pair. It's been a long time, we walked a thin line. Others say they got you but you been mine. But you love the dogg, gave me the spotlight. And now I'm growin up, showin up, blowin up. I never ever thought that we would separate at all. But you played me like a game of football. Used to feed me, need me, dress me. Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me. Hollywood divorce. All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing. Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap. Not even talkin about music. Everything else too. By the time it reach Hollywood it's over. But it's cool. We just keep it goin and make new shit. Take our game, take our name. Give us a little fame. And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang. "

And kid yo, I never rocked with laws they keep away, we cool. I devised my own stimulus plan. I'm niggarish. I'm tired of eating those crumbs and black licorice. To free my mind on Friday, I cleanse in the mosque. Let the imam pray over my head and wash. Thoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly. Watch us gift men and fetch the green like barley. If that shit happen I'll feed his whole army. Talking 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali. Try to stay humble and swallow my pride. In God I trust. now talk about the ones on your five. Crisp dollar billing, catch me in a little hut in Benin. Village style, feeding the children. Big pots of jasmine tea with Mandela. Africans chanting me on like Coachella. Ghostface Bumaye. Kumbaya my Lord. My death day, 24 karat tomb I lay. Wishing they could bury me next to the prophets. Nabi, Lut, Is'a, Musa, Hadrat Muhammad, Ibrahim. The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds. High currents, distance, places be forming wings. Kings offering. Man with the seven crowns. his dome. rose petals. sold from the ghetto. Face froze in gold like the pharaoh. Adorned in glory, robe of light, a power for his cherub. Eternal heartbeat. Embraced to write, then threw the crooks in the ocean. Skin brass hair like it grew from goatskin. tablets. were broken. The smoke hand grabs an omen. Gravity grabbing me gradually, dragging me through Hell's cavity. This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals feed. God felt bad for me. but cast me in the Caspian Sea. K.P., K.P. He used to sling in the stairwell. Fast to put the rap on a thinking cap. ignite your hair gel. No such thing as the fair sale. He'll put the bullet out same day. And on this level a thug will sell your garbage. No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge. But the users just kept coming back with their life earnings. Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning. The outcome tragic, the household dramatic. Living rooms for heating spoons, basements for addicts. Support from a bean, hit the courts from a fiend. Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team. So he sent them gifts, body parts per diem. In a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em. "

To accept his gift, required impossible risk. And loneliness in the midst of adoration. But to deny him - madness. Then, there was Phobetor, whom they called the dread crawler. For he dwelled only in nightmares. And fed on the acrid fumes of human fear. A shapeshifter, he appeared as the manifestation of terror. Forcing a choice between the path of uncertainty. And the path, of mediocrity. To meet Phobetor's gaze required great courage. To look away - shame. Only in the grey hour, in the moments of shadow and light. Will the balance of power dangle. Between the destiny bringer's favor. And the dread crawler's wrath. Only there, between waking and sleep. Will we recognize, our true path. "

I meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour. Then got drier, put on attire to inspire. Hit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire. Laid around and lounged \'til around two. Then I got up and ate, drank a brew and caught a page from the crew. Sayin\' "Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat. Bring a sack, ayo it\'s Saturday, it\'s gonna be fat. Now it\'s 3:37 and I still ain\'t left the rest. Electric Relaxation from A Tribe Called Quest. With the boom, tokin\', smokin\', coolin\' out. As I parlay in my room cause it\'s a lazy afternoon.

Then you feel the thunder and rain I don?t talk it like the rainbow. Going hard will get you two shots now I?m facing the charge. Fire up the la let?s go take a ride. They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide. Sort of like Mike at the United Center. Madison Square, Boston Garden I straight ignite on niggas. I?m pulled over by the jakes, a twenty-eight up in my nuts. Feel like fuck a friend a hundred million haters ain?t enough. Life is a blunt and the world is my ash tray. I got them quarters and them halves just meet me like halfway. And I need a hundred percent of my profit ain't fucking with half pay. As I can recollect, praying to God this dope?ll stretch. I?ll take it into Heaven, you couldn?t buy me that, remind me that. You can Google my name but you ain't gotta search. I?m right here in the streets, I'm putting in work.

Although I\'m never slippin\' like student parent permission. Yes, I am aware that America tryna get me. So I let my friends carry paraphernalia. Before I love a industry girl, I\'ll marry civilian. Picture a young, rich woman taking me serious. Although I hit my stride, ain\'t even in prime (nah). Singles in the chart make a broad lose top these days. You ain\'t gotta do nothin to pop these days. Instagram is runnin\' they thoughts these days. 62 joint, got me Doug-in on em. Humbled, got my ass dropped now I\'m stuntin\' on \'em.

Another brother caught up in the business. Had that lock since I lost my scholarship. I been gettin\' it to my old coach and ballin\'. Rose gold was forty,. dopest nigga recordin\'. Make hoes sprint the 40. See me I thought money would change it it got worse. But its alot better than screamin "who got work?" (who got work?). From opening up for Back to packing out 9:30.

S'here\'s the Priest Offering. Shootouts, drugs, liquor stores, broken projects. I swear my heart left that time I dodged death. I said "God Bless". I paint Sanskrit across my canvas. Eye on the great space probing along the face of the deep. To below on Earth where the cops chases the creeps and the thieves. this the Exodus. Black on black crimes and crack 9s we clap. They cuff your wrist behind your back. The ghettos infested with drugs and police. He had flames in his eyes, told me it wasn\'t from wine. Said "Yeah I look familiar you saw me when you stared in the mirror". Drop off his dusty blanket. And what was standing there was a King\'s ancient royal robes. With diamonds and rubies, God\'s beauty, life truly. A blessing, in my essence, Priest. I slid the lid back off my coffin. I\'m writing lyrics while fighting spirits they poking pitchforks. A hooker lip gloss smears on my cheek she threw her kiss off. While trying to stick a dagger through the Priest. '

S'Each within his mulish days to choose his tool of trade. Dueling blades that cued a cruel charade and fuel the flames. Few would clue the crew into the civil. Skip the food and land like you the man. Who flew the coop over the pitbulls. Dash back flashy to compassionate nanopolice who sat beneath an avalanche of jagged inadequacies. And I was "Stop the Violence" more than I was Pontius Pilate. Cops and robbers riot by the five\'s obnoxious sirens. A. is gullible he figure, "all man equal, no brainer". Take it his friends and neighbors didn\'t cater. Moms raised the babies through a very churchy 80\'s. Sunday mornings reinforce the waiting gates of Hades. And he brazen but apparently inferno bound now. For when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn\'t bow down. The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him. Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them. Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunners deck. Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous. And you. observe and have the givetheth disproportionate. To the taketh away. decide to maketh his day (do it). All the stoic odium glow in a cold holster. To where he coulda stood easily in the tub jugglin toasters. No mountain too high. No city too far. No coma tonight. No city tomorrow. No fire too live. No city too charred. No treaty to sign. No city to guard. I picked the phone up with a grown-up mode approach. Skin crawlin off the drawl and now I claw the awkward tone up. I\'d known it wasn\'t roses. But hoped it was less corrosive. Coastin to the focus of the grossest diagnosis. Like homes, the barnacles that chew upon the flesh of man. Have clued into the suitor was capital to a beggar\'s hand. And uncomfortably. sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony. With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood in meat. Chinny chin-up and the city picked this. In a pent-up letter numbed the spitting stigma. Along came a spider, sold her eggs to any buyer. Now to shoot a ringer back with six legs wider than the driver. If you make no friends on the way to the top rung. There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck. But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard. So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your canons. All kings hang em for the cliffs side drip dry. Will he clip the zipline or slip for his final dip dive?. If he live will he survive the milligrams of middle-ground. They pump into the pin-striped pentagrams over Tinsel-town. Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miles high. No city too charred. No treaty to sign. No city to guard. '

Every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves. We go together / break up. We go together / break up. Ain\'t this an insecure bitch, meanin we love to make up. When we good, we good shawty. We don\'t ever make love. But if I call you out your name, I bet your ready to "uh!". You say you ready, you ain\'t ready enough. Cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up. This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit. She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done. [Bridge: Lloyd]. Cause I, am feeling this deep down in my heart. I\'m feeling like I never want to be apart. But just when it gets good, she\'s gone. And I\'m left right back at start... [Hook: Lloyd]. My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah. She can only take so much more than her heart got. She can only live for the moment. Why? I\'ll never know it. Guess I\'ll meet her right back at start. Let\'s roll a J and pretend we in love. I\'ve got a paper plane, it\'s propelling my buzz. I\'m trying to make a way, she never call back. She\'s tryna fall back, cuz she say I\'m all that. She only love me when I be ignoring. When I be doing throwin it on her, shorty brushing me off. I swear, I kinda feel like she\'s slightly bizarre. have me Avatar\'d. Blue ball, who fault? Mine, only cause I stick around. She leave before the sun up, leave you something to think about. Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse. Ha, that make it hard to be faithful. Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more. Ten more depending on where Wale going. Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long. It?s weird shawty, your wares showing me dead wrong. You gon\' miss a good thing, end up bitter alone. Shit ain?t better alone. I get her once I bet you keep coming back for more. Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for more. Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for.... She need now, she ain\'t never needed love. Let her go, let her leave. This is something that could never ever be. Said her hearts, in a cage. Cuz if you never love, you can never hate. Marinate. [Bridge: Lloyd]. Sabotage, sabotage, I love you. Sabotage, sabotage, I love you. Sabotage, I love how you keep coming back for more. Keep coming back for more. Keep coming back for more. '

S'My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport. And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings. It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs. The pigs (what), the pigs (what),. the dregs of what y\'all aim for. The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole. Two-track. braniac using the food and payroll. To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso. And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient. As the bourbon-odor smokers\' coughs smolder off the Cohiba. If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship. He could\'ve snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking.... Take money, money... pigs!. Let\'s make a deal.... When all the wolves in woolly wigs. Have huffed, and puffed, and blew the bricks. The skulls of Brooklyn\'s cruelest pigs. Will rain. on Fulton\'s newest kicks. As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness. We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison. I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed. No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers. I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers. Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice. Never that, Wilburs multiply quicker than triples. And hunt their truffles in fistfuls. but it was all bells and whistles. Bougie this and Bougie that.... War pig or pussy cat.. Glitzy to the pork ribs. had to gold-leaf the booby traps. Powder-pink, double-breasted, mess of mud and money. And while I don\'t really know the working details of your tribes. I know that that\'s one ugly fucking tie. Apple in his mouth, Maraschino eyes. Party like the butcher boy\'s cleaver is alive. To see the county fair\'s blue ribbon winner as dinner. Corporates want to lure him in and whore him. Or does he whore the corparates to expand the more important forums for him. Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard. When the frilly border\'s faded is the product mine or yours, pig?. plus I toss a token where I go:. Directly to. the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow. And will subsequently know the armor-piercing forks of farmers. Final words for the finer birds taking notes. I dig a chick in pig tails. "That\'s all Folks!". '

I'll be the jenky Jesus for the species you bleed with. Ultra, soldier poach the folklore. Jump guns through the ninth gate. Jump guns like a noon six burner lit up on the ninth pace.

You come here, since you're so interested - fight me. Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts. Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft. Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings. Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing. The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry. A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry. Herbal vapors and biblical papers. Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush. Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression. Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing. Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome. Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss. Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings. Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings. I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides. On July 4th in Bed-Stuy. Where money don't grown on trees and there's. thieving MC's. Who cut-throat to rake leaves. They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast. Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver. Duel of the Iron Mic!. It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!. This is not a '85 affair made clear. When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up. Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct. Killer Beez are stinging while I reveal. Science that's heavily guarded by the culprit. Bombing your barracks with aerodynamic. Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway. Minds that's laced with explosive doses. Damaging lyrical launcher. Lunge at the youthful offender. injure. Any contender. testing the murderous Master. Could lead to disaster,. dynamite thoughts. Explode through your barrier,. rips the retina. Stings to the sternum,. shocked in the Hip Hop livestock. Seeking for a serum to cure em. Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust. Ducking handcuffs. throats get cut when dough rush. Out of town foes look shook but still pose. We move like real pros through the streets we stroll. Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh. So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold. Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers. Bitches caught in airports, Ki's in they vaginas. No peace, yo the police mad corrupt. You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut. Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless. Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest. Individual, critical thoughts,. criminal minded. Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing. Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh. Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep. And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!. At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another. Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy. In the passion and depth of their struggle. The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost. Their techniques vanished. "

It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze). Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates. Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead. Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said. "Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car". "Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar". He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the cannister. Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher. On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell. Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell. Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth. That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs. Same cops known for exorting pimps and booking whores. Aimed Glocks at me and Rae, cause they was looking for. A few MC\'s wanted for a string of break-ins. Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins. [Hook: Slick Rick]. We will, we will, rob you. We will, we will, Glock you. We will, we will, what? who? (not you). Here we go.

Soon I see some thighs and my eyes open wide quick. Who's that with you, chick?. Bill Blass my sidekick. What's up, black? Give his hand a smack. Then up pulls a Cadillac, yo baby we'll be back. Jumped right on inside, not too many people saw us. Thinking about who gotta get robbed because the mob got a job for us. The drove us down to this other section. Of town where the clowns there be paying for protection. The want us to send a message to Jimmy the bartender. Lend a friend the money, next you're ripping off his car fenders. He's coming up short cause he snorts. Coke, dope, nope, and hope he don't get caught. He owes some Benjamin Franklins, every last bit of em. But Jimmy's pockets are empty, so now we gotta get rid of him. But Jimmy's wife is with him and they don't want to involve her. Hopped out the back seat they gave me a revolver. Blass, you distract him while I go and whack him. Entered through the back side of the bar and then attacked him. He's screaming for his life, reaching for his wife. Shot him in the back of the head and shanked him with a knife. And that goes for anybody who's gotta pay they dues. You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues. You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (x4). [Verse 2]. Suckers I clobber, because my town is full of cops and robbers. You're not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors. So I got to get with the business and hit quick. Moneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick slick. Hold it right here, hands in the air, I know you got the loot. Or better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop. Hit the deck, I got the Tec right on your neck. And I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveler's check. But if a vic' tries to choke me. I'll have to smoke him like I'm Smokey the Bear, so okie dokie. Goodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey. Don't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me. So to the next weasel that freezes. Your begging and your pleases only getting ya closer to meeting Jesus. Yeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck. Then I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a fuck. Hyper as a sniper piping niggas like a plumber. Cold vicking and sticking up the ones that run the numbers. Or even a bigger score, the lady in the liquor store. Go inside then kick in the door, pull her then I'm stickin her for. Money or your life, honey hurry and choose. You lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues. You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (x4). [Verse 3]. Extra extra read all about it in the papers. The boss tried to rape us, so we tossed him off the skyscraper. Because he pulled some other people to try and hit us. Get us, but none of them did us, he must be trying to kid us. But that's dead, I'll thank God in the red,. 'cross the bread borders. So nobody can short us,. But yo, the man can't even stick me with some Krazy Glue. We took out all the lookouts in the front and kicked his door in. What's up snake, why'd you violate?. They called him a  chazer (What's that?). Yo, that's a pig that don't fly straight. Getting ready to jab him, I grabbed him by the necktie. Homie tried to get fly, and swing I gave him a decked eye. You know the evil that men do, hell is where the men go. We snatched him by his hands and feet and threw him out the window. Up, up, and away cause I don't play, clown. Buck, buck, buck, take that with you on the way down. I'm hoping you got springs and wings on your shoes. But you lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues. You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (x4). "

S'Atticus. Shatter your algebra with calculus. Damage your patterns I\'m pounding you so fabulous. Huffing and puffing, discussing absolutely nothing, disgusting me. Plus infinity\'s up in me rushing your country percussion. No wonder you\'re struck in the boundaries. And I\'m stomping my foot through your armies. They couldn\'t have stopped me with shotties. Oddity, why did he, why do these entire societies inside of societies. And survivors still remain alive (Release) emcees. Thriving to flow, opting to go. Five hundred and fifty-five syllables to go. Split em\' with the subliminal intentional digital pro. Unlimited flows unriveted, inhibited, visited. Now you can\'t get rid of it like (Release) what is this. Pigs lick shit. Inner breathlessness, outer restlessness. By the time I caught up to freedom I was out of breath. Grandma asked me what I\'m running for. I guess I\'m out for the same thing the sun is sunning for. What mothers birth their youngens for. And some say Jesus coming for. For all I know the earth is spinning slow. Suns at half mast cause masses ain\'t aglow. On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree. I\'ve made the forest suit me. Tables and chairs. Papers and prayers. Matter versus spirit. A metal ladder. A wooden cross. A plastic bottle of water. A mandala encased in glass. A spirit encased in flesh. Sound from shaped hollows. The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion. A man that cries in his sleep. A truth that has gone out of fashion. A mode of expression. A paint splattered wall. A carton of cigarettes. A bouquet of corpses. A dying forest. A nurtured garden. A privatized prison. A candle with a broken wick. A puddle that reflects the sun. A piece of paper with my name on it. I\'m surrounded. I surrender. All. All that I am I have been. All I have been has been a long time coming. I am becoming all that I am. The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute. Unheard, yet felt. A gathered wetness. A quiet moisture. Sound trapped in a bubble. Released into wind. Wind fellows and land merchants. We are history\'s detergent. Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath. Articles amending death. These words are not tools of communication. They are shards of metal. Dropped from eight story windows. They are waterfalls and gas leaks. Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf. The tools of a trade. Barter\'s bard, barb of barters. Catch phrases and misunderstandings. But they are not what I feel when I am alone. Surrounded by everything and nothing. And there isn\'t a word or phrase to be caught. A verse to be recited. A mantra to fill my being in those moments. I am blankness, the contained center of an "O". The pyramidic containment of an "A". I stand in the middle of all that I have learned. All that I have memorized. All that I\'ve known by heart. Unable to reach any of it. There is no sadness. There is no bliss. It is a forgotten memory. A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking. There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless. They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness. But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence. Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas. Like dead rats held by their tails. So as not to infect this newly oiled skin. I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane. I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal. I can think of nothing less likely to fly. There are no wings more weighted. I too have felt a heaviness. The stare of man guessing at my being. Yes I am homeless. A homeless man making offerings to the after-future. Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles. A nation unified in exhale. A cloud of smoke. A native pipe ceremony. All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps. Snow covered mountains. Lipsticks smeared and shriveled. Offerings to an afterworld. Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers. Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls. It\'s all overwhelming me, oak and elming me. I have seeded a forest of myself. Little books from tall trees. It matters not what this paper be made of. Give me notebooks made of human flesh. Dried on steel hooks and nooses. Make uses of use, uses of us. It\'s all overwhelming me, oak and elming me. I have seeded a forest of myself. Little books from tall trees. On bended knee. Prostrate before an altered tree. I\'ve made the forest suit me. Tables and chairs. Papers and prayers. Matter vs. spirit. Through meditation. I program my heart to beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation. The heaven-sent benevolent medicine man reverend. Peddling deliverance that resemble amphetamines to. The residents in the meadow of pestilence. Who developed a chemical dependence on pessimism. The most distinctive speaker seeping through your sleepy speakers. Ain\'t no secret, people, trust me. It\'s mostly hustling. That moves me upstream. Boasting and fussing. They both so unproductive. Ask anybody, that\'s anybody. They\'ll tell you that the antibody to the petty. Potty mouth gossiping is. Success at something. To be the best at something. And not to stress the dumb shit. Cause you ain\'t missing nothing. Motivate, accelerate, never wait, know your weight, throw away hate. Grow and make weight of your older days. Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate fate. Just motivate, accelerate, never wait, show the way, no escape. Take hold and shift shape, live a longer day. Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate fate. Astrologists, colleges follow this through the metropolis. The dominant brown bomber, I\'m in it, being prominent. They all pray for our downfall. Maybe one day, sike!. snake. I\'m mongoosing on you. You\'re a Tom Thumb. King Kong Bundy. Strong thunder, all summer long, keep on coming. Dawn, dusk, night, morning. '

Who the fucks need ice inside of burning alcohol. I reach in my pockets to tip the whore. But I\'m clumsy, my change start falling on the floor. I play macho, and say leave it for the sweeper. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP my fucking beeper. I start stumbling to the phone booth. Revealing all symptoms of drinking ninety proof. The phone booth door is closed, the light is on. The girlie just dialed nine-seven-zero porn. She sit back, with her legs cocked in the air. While her fingers do the walking through her knotty pubic hair. Her eyes are shut tight, she moans and groan. I hit the glass, "Get the fuck off the phone!". She jumped up and said, "You just had to be the one. To interrupt me when I was having so much fun". I said, "Hold up, yo, bitch you think it\'s cute. To be perverted let alone a sleazy prostitute". She said, "How can you try to disrespect any female. Or me and my homegirls just because we sell". I said, "Pussy? That\'s what you call it?". She screamed out, "You\'re god damn right you alcoholic!". She said, "This is a public phone and you do not run it". I said, "So is your pussy but can I use it when I want it?". I was in Times Square, loungin hard. the Prince Rakeem. Watchin females posin for a flick. Thinking of who would be the first to turn a trick. "Yo Genius you see that?" "Yeah" "So what you think?". "Let\'s swing em to the nearest spot to have a drink". I winked at one she said, "Hi" in a low pitch. Now we searchin for a zebra lounge. To settle down, right in the heart of midtown. Went to this place, called the Sting Pit. Got inside and seen all types of shit. Men who looked soft but acting wild. Dancing to the beat, Ten City style. Females who wore jeans that were tight. With faces resembling transvestites. They smiled at me and the God, showin all thirty-two. That\'s when I caught the clue. As this red-bone, who thought she looked fly. Rolled up on me, and she said "Hi". That one little word fucked up the whole night. Her voice was deeper, than Barry White. I jumped up, and boy did I flip. I pull out a nine and I empty the clip. The place was flowin with crazy blood. A little midtown massacre type flood. And as we stepped off from the scene. Here\'s the message I got from Rakeem. '

We can wait, no pressure, I'll be patient. She said stop calling me, I'm taking a vacation. So there it was decorated with the wordplay. I'm at school and I'm tryna hide my hurt face.

Now I'm standin' at this gravel roadside festival. And I ain't tryin' to move cause this view is incredible. Standin' at the bottom of the steps. And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress. And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew. So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue. Fall in love with all of she (Fall in love with all of she). Hasn't stopped callin' me (Hasn't stopped callin' me). Message in a bottle (There's a message in a bottle). And I stepped inside a pothole (I stepped inside a pothole). Somehow forgot my name (Somehow forgot my name). Blew out the flame (She blew out the flame). A means to an end (A means to an end). Can't even be friends, it's a song about a friend. She's still in my dreams (She steals all my dreams). Angel spread your wings (Angel spread your wings).

Punishments that were set to wash the brain. So look listen observe and also respect this jewel. Drawed up, detect and reflect this. Light I shine. because my powers is refined.

S"And the last shall be. First to immerse in the pass out heat. Face in the mud where the moxie melt. 'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell. More in a cave with a torch on the wall. Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls. Property owners who crawl to the mall. With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law. Pace like he mourning a loss. Right hand on a can of worms. Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean. That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day. But a model of mercy and might, no way. Marionette who will clap and obey. Dude, look, all that noise. Call that flight of the water boys. Meet and greet and they all slap five. Cheek to cheek when they colonize. And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish. Walk that path with a dime and a stick. Walk that path with a diamond and wine. Walk that path to the firing line. Just walk, pay no mind. To the new recruit with the play-doh spine. Let's be friends from opposite ends. Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence. Play to the radius far and away. Orbit wide don't park in his space. One little martyr who talk in his face. Make one little. Weathermen. mad cow meat. Face in the bars of a regular cell. When he woke up high in collectible hell. Boom town kid who was taught by the binge. That a man who expire with the most shit win. That's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich. Not a routine friend in a pinch. Still not used to the stench. How it throws off otherwise lucid events. In the case the afraid observe. I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes. Hey, peace, pray for the plagued. Major relief and capacious rains. But just cuz I don't want to war with you. It don't mean go warm up the barbecue. sawed off limit. My high noon is a quick little minute. I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic. Who simply isn't going to ever really get it. This HQ is alive and alone. No driveway no sign of a home. No dial tone, no line for the phone. No world's tiniest violin song. And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue. With a deep breath hiding and bored. Fighting a smile, highly annoyed. When the timing is right I will rise and record. Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got. Animal drums like he's doctor teeth. It goes red light green light 1 2 3. One large coffee, fuck you, peace. T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S. T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S. T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S. T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S. T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S. I crawled down to the basement. When the weather got cold. Like a lost lamb returning to the fold. And when the outside world recedes from view. It's just a year's supply of make-up. And memories of you. 1967 Colt 45. holding back the vampires. "

I prolly triple my gross in and by every September. Music got me feeling like heaven is secular. Cuz all the girls that I be with look like angel but thicker. Without Lola. we out Garfield goin\' Odie. With rap performance of Forbes got me catchin\' up Oprah. Passionate poet, can adapt to the camera. You see rappin\' is showbiz, they some talented actors. It be childish to diss \'em, I just fuck all they bitches. Another city look at outer space. All my niggas in the front, see. And shit they never see get any bitch that they could ever want. The loneliness, this Hennessy\'s the only antidote. It\'s on to the good. turn some jams on. Funkadelic bumpin\' through the speakers on my headphones.

S'Came empty handed and left the same. A soul is a soul, and a shell is a shell. The border in between is full of everything you felt. Some cling to a cross because they\'re tired and lost. They leave it up to the weather to measure the cost. And every time I look within I recognize the darkness. Familiar to the image of the artist. Staring at the bathroom mirror in a stranger\'s apartment. Can\'t remember her name, don\'t remember how I got here. But here I am, thinking about death again. Humbles out the stress, helps the breath get in. I need to check my friends as well as my next of kin. To let them know I love them all to the end. And when the soul begins to reap, I think she\'ll know me from the sleep. I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes. And if she has the nerve, to let me dump a couple last words. I\'m gonna turn to the earth and scream "Love your life!". Love your life, quite cliche but I guess that\'s me. A ball of pop culture with some arms and feet. As discrete as I\'ve tried to keep the drama and cancer. It\'s no secret I hunger for someone to feed the answers. I never expected a bowl of cherries. I\'m just a Virgo. trying to find my own version of the Virgin Mary. And when I let them carry me to a cemetery. I wanna be buried with a pocket full of clarity. Now, how many times must you prove you\'re an angel. How many more demons do you have to strangle. How much longer must you remain in this dream. Before I finally figure out if you\'re insane or a genius. Let no tears to fall from none of y\'all. Just remember it all, the beauty as well as the flaws. L-O-V-E L-I-F-E. Here lies Sean, finally free. And as I look across the sea I smile at the sun. While it feeds the weeds the nutrition they need. The people still breathe, the city still bleeds. I\'m going to love it to death and keep planting my seeds. I\'m going to love it to death and keep an eye on the seeds. I\'ll be in love till im dead, I keep reaching the seeds. I\'ll give all I got left just to teach you to read. Love life to the death and keep planting my seeds. And when the soul begins to reap,. I think she\'ll know me from the sleep. I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes. And if she has the nerve, to let me dump a couple last words. I\'m gonna turn to the earth and scream (Love your life). LOVELIFE. (Outro). Life, love, stress and setbacks. '

S'standing on two twelve inch feet. quasi-Draconian. Peyote leaves. In a room where the ceiling leaks of crimson grease. Where the living eats the dead and the dead reek. Rock bottom transforms human beings to beasts. Why the fuck you think we\'ve got canine teeth?. Cause when I speak what\'s fluid becomes concrete. Like a falcon up in the sky, ten thousand feet. Looking down at you bitches looking at me. Sucking from the breast of knowledge constantly weaning. Try to visualize what Harry Houdini was feeling. Handcuffed underwater without breathing. Near death on a fatal quest for air. But why should anyone care? He put himself there. His career was based on facing his fears. To take destiny from the hand of the man upstairs. It\'s better to be prepared and fail. Than to be scared and unsure of yourself and still get killed. Don\'t rhyme like I used to but I still got skills. More than a couple confirmed kills under the belt. Hunting emcees like hunting elk. Camouflaged in the dense brush for stealth, determined as Hell. I don\'t do this for anybody except myself. Stuff a motherfucker like a trophy on my shelf. Fuck the promo nigga I do this for dolo. Flow from the first hour to twenty-four-oh-oh. Round the clock as long as I\'ve got a cup of cocoa. But I\'ll be a no-show if my girl cries, "Don\'t go!". minus the G.O.A.T. \'Bus is dope, my battling average is higher than most. When I\'m on the mic I release fire from throat. Black man? No! What about the \'Great White Hope?\'. What? Man you must be sniffing great white coke. Don\'t you know that\'s like Gary Coleman fighting the Hulk?. Still not even quite that close. a great white. Biting your rubber dingy boat. 50 miles out from the coast. What the fuck is the Mathers with you?. I\'ll beat you black and blue. then I\'ll get a tat of you too. Better yet I\'ll put a tattoo of me on you. A ten by ten \'C\' logo, neon blue. The most theatrical MC battle of all time. Technically these words shouldn\'t even rhyme off paper. Can\'t you see what I\'m spitting? Can\'t you hear the difference?. Compared to me you\'re energetically inefficient. You need ten times the enzymes to process one of my rhymes. You\'ve got to rewind every one of my lines. Do you know how to paraphrase?. Do you even understand what the narrator is tryna say?. Academic journals print my lyrical quotes. They show parallelism in all the albums I wrote. The Eye of Horus. the miniature torii within a giant torus. With singularity on the chorus, I still sound enormous. If you\'ve got a hundred bars then I know you\'re a warrior. You want a record deal?. Explain the lyrical grand unified field so I can test your skill. Do it in front of the class, chart diagram it. And write it in Latin not Spanish god damn it. (No puede entender las palabras que digo senior Williams?). You\'re clumsy and dumb like a hand with five thumbs. '

Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man. Stand close to his main man like a chain gang. That\'s no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew. "Well I oughta". I suggest you hand over the formula doula. A villain in your land, in his land a ruler. Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura. Every day feel like it\'s an off day with Ferris Bueller. Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet. No matter how you spell it, we still got beats. Don\'t question how we live, question what we give. Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can\'t truss it. mic is the tool. Drink Jack,. Contemplate, meditate, dictate. K.Nit. K-N-I-T. Sub R-O-C. M-I-C. By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes \'til I\'m burnt out. Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about. Topics and views, generally concerned about. With different ways to come up and earn clout. I take a look at my life and pace the trails. From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils. You out your frame but still bagging \'em too. You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I\'m you. Like my twin brother, we did everything together. From hundred raka\'at salats to copping butter leathers. Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys. I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles. The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock. Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block. I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand.

Confronted by the devil himself and stay strong. You think you can take the King now meet Kong. Strong as the base of a mountain, there's no counting. How many MCs have sprung from our fountain.

Yo, yo, drunk or sober, son, don't lose your composure. Semi off the Remy, mixed with Henny, Moet demi'. Underneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi'. Israeli issued automatic black pistol. The cop with the flashlight chew gum as he whistle. Tapped on the glass, roll it down fast. License, registration addressed to your lab. the reason why I pulled you over. Cuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober. Have you been drinking? Breathe into the breathalyzer. Get out the car, please, follow this exercise, sir. Put one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe. Walk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road. My homeboy Kano, used to do the mashed potato. Or cartwheels and then spin out like a tornado. They used to chase him, right; but son, he would always shake em. Then come and puff bowls. and make beats inside my basement. Drunk or sober, never lose your composure. Stress on the brain cause pain and stomach ulcers. If you can't understand, then come closer. "

S"Get enough love, got enough friends. But on a regular basis it's safe to say I've got the bends. And I didn't mean to ignore that vibe you sent. I guess my mind was probably on my rent. Oh I got my mind on my tummy, and my tummy on my mind. Some assembly required, let me run it down the line. The factory is open, time card punched. Until lunch time it's crunch time, back to work. Fool, the first rule is to keep the verse true. Even if it hurts you, you gotta wear the pain like a stain. Respect the listener, respect the game. Because there's more to game than some dinner and fame. I've seen things that used to be dreams. My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug. All I really want is for you to remember my name. And I'mma run for as long as I'm allowed. And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll. See I'm that cat that used to sit in the back and study. Looking for some proof, that God loves ugly. Flash forward a decade later in your town. Somehow, a good number of ya'll got down. And it's solid, fresh, dope, whatever you wanna call it. Not bad for an aspiring sociopathic alcoholic. Look at Slug still rockin' the same outfit. Tryin to make the belly grow bigger than the wallet. Just been makin it cool to rap about love again. Not that hippie stuff I'm talkin 'bout that bitch that gets you nuts. Did he say bitch? Yeah I'm sorry, don't tell my baby's mommy. Speakin of baby, when done, there'll be a crate full of albums. For my son to page through, thinking daddy was a gun. still standing in the land of snow and purple rain. And I'm still waitin for my date to kiss me or slap me. Cause there ain't no way that I can be happy, when I'm happy. I've had the pleasure of speaking with some of you. Yeah you, come on now, don't act like you don't know who I'm talking to. After that show, when you approached me like you know me. The cd I sold you, the secrets that you told me. On that world you vision, through the layers of tears. The ones you choke and keep hidden when the players are near. I watch you chase it with beer, some frustration and fear. Try to figure out why the hell I came here. Well I don't know either, and I'm not ready to take a breather, neither. All I know is I'm still a believer. So you can beat me up, or you can beat me off. Pick a side, any side, and let me do my job, come on. If you've got a lot of love to give, but you don't know who to give it to. I'mma turn out the lights of the cigarette, and write a song about you. This one's for you. What does ugly mean?. "

Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within. In a world full of BS that we're livin' in. To my ears music sounds sweet as cinnamon. So I stay poundin' out tunes again and again. It's the 5th chapter ladies and gentlemen. And I still got MCs on my dinner menu. I'm like a letter man so. Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome. Shootin' through your veins, vibratin' though your eardrums. Seen the world two times all except India. About to vacay there when we finish this one. Work hard but still some sleep.

Well that\'s quite true,. bust-a-move. head game lovable. Bust that pussy open, turn that sofa to a fuckin pool. I\'m playing Cody,. smoking stogies. make the rhythm better.

And we fuck, I beast up and throw a little peace up. So peace out, I\'mma get up with you in like 3 months. Word, absence will make the heart grow. With that said, I ain\'t around like my old combs.

And begged him not to take her wedding band. Now everybody\'s in shock, and I\'m walking past. The scared ass passengers with the nine millimeter cocked. Lookin for who was next. And sittin by the pole was a old ass man wearin a Rolex. I took the shit and hit the bastard hard. Ripped his pants clean off his ass and got the Visa and the MasterCard. My little man said, "A-yo check this,". He pointed at this bitch who looked rich, wearin a long pearl necklace. Word to God, she got my dick hard, and that was the truth. So I drug her ass inside the conductor\'s booth. As the ho started to shout, I threw her on her knees. And made her freeze and put my dick inside her pretty mouth. All of the sudden I just, nutted. Pulled up my pants and zipped up. She\'s on the floor with her mouth flooded. Tore him a new asshole, right through his bullshit vest. But the pig was still breathin. I wanted to finish him off, but I said, "Fukkit, I\'m leavin". '

S'Started with a 100, the Game spit 3, I said, "Fuck it. I\'ma have to show these niggas something". Too easy, who\'d believe me if I said that it wasn\'t?. The rhyme is a weapon, I bust it, the Brotherhood got me covered. OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars. I drive forward, sandstorms make my eyes water. Skull is a submarine hull. Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as A.G.C.R. The rhymes are raw, deeper than yours. You crawled before you walked but didn\'t think about your thoughts before you talked. We spit for sport, I won you lost. But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross. This is \'The Greatest Rhyme of All Time\' supposedly. 1000 Bars it will probably always be. Mentally top heavy, not many can rock with me. Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me. I said, "Nobody benefits, everyone perishes". I tell them this, they say, "Here, it\'s time for your medicine". Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line. When I inspired Hova and Nas. I listened to \'44 4\'s\' 22 times. \'I Gave You Power\', God stop my heart if I\'m lying. You like red or white wine? Let\'s talk about it I\'m buying. Let\'s talk about the Children of Zion, excuse me if I start crying. The art of rhyming? I\'ve mastered it certainly. surely. I\'ll celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy. From the streets of New Jersey to Germany. To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me. The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery. Ritual Widow Murder, searching for her urgently. Mix the blood so it don\'t coagulate. The sex magik won\'t work if the bitch masturbates. I put her on cloud nine, look at her face. A cumulus lenticularis, a capsule in Space. You will become acquainted with my cryptic language. And my mystic manners, Rip spit bananas. Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis. Reload the graphics, notice I spit it rapid. Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility. Most MCs try to clone me lyrically. My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically. But my true symmetry is energy. The Will of Claude Ashur. The skill of Germaine. Father Author Poor Pauper Pastor, more than a rapper. My body is a human machine, my dreams filter in between. Just wait until I build my machine. Kill you with weed vapour. then a taser. Then a maser,. then a phaser,. then something they call scalar. "That is not dead which can eternally lie. And with strange aeons even death may die". But why? Coup de gr?ce for the coup d\'?tat. In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God. Battle Rap there is no such art. Emotion manifests thought, thought manifests words, actions and reality. This is not fantasy. If you question me, you will be detained indefinitely. Blacklist Registry. I\'m a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands. On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand. If I am not myself, then how would I be?. If I do not look tell me how will I see?. The Law of Attraction is attracted to me. The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively. I look at my face more than anybody else. I still can\'t recognize myself. But on the other hand these rappers are worthless. At least from my interconnected introspective perspective. The more pretentious, the more apprehensive the sentence. You are lazy, you wanna be the best, you crazy. The best train every day of the week. My lyricism amplifies every letter written. Rip the Jacker spitting inside a Zero Vector Systems. Brain waves reveal High Yield E&D Fields. Chew MCs like I\'m eating a meal. A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real. A bunch of fake King Midas\' with fools gold grills. My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was. The Period of Purification in my poems. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock. It\'s no use if you can\'t use what you got. Buried in a mass grave covered in bones. My cell phone number\'s placed on their tombstones. Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude. She better do it, I don\'t wanna have to hurt you dude. I\'ll eat from the same portion as you. Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to. A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers. Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other. I don\'t care if we\'re not the same colour, nigga I\'m your brother. I don\'t care what you say nigga you a nigga lover. All cultures come from One Mind. The Universe is not far behind. waves, bars and rhymes. I don\'t care if I make history, I wanna be a part of infinity. I am energy, I am He spiritually and mentally. The fools who threw away my jewels offended me. As we walk through the archived files of all styles. The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles. More rappers than fans, more fans wrapped in vans. Hip Hop will continue to expand. Poets should be rappers, rappers should be lyricists. The current industry model collapse imminent. Larry King Live, earthquake right outside. I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye. Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins. Who could tell me that this poem is luck. You say I\'m crazy, I say "So, tell me something I don\'t know". Something my psyche profile doesn\'t show. I don\'t have all the answers I am not in the know. I can only see what is above and only from below. The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy. How can it be Canibus? Answer me!. I approached the podium, and delivered my encomium. Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous, 130. They feared I would spit, they don\'t like when I bust. From a very cold place called Faraday Base. The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes. Lead them to believe I was lying. I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver. Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers. Dig a hole for the collateral carnage, Battle the hardest. Take out Hip Hops trash & garbage. Tunnel boring and jacking, water main tapping. I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing,. But Hip Hop started hating, I tried to save them they wasn\'t patient. If you pursue revenge, dig many graves. Be sure to add your name to the list that you\'ve made. Distinguished English and Sophisticated senses. In sync with the Talisman I received from the Temptress. With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit. Whenever I spit it, concentrate you can hear it. I\'ve almost perfected this, I\'m one word away from excellence. When I find it I\'ll begin testing it. The phenomenal beast astronomer priest. Sirius Star system. To observe the Gods. The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder, created by King Osiris. My psychic wall larger than Chinas. The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth. Several million years into the past. A primitive future in a world without oil and gas. Focus on two standards when assessing the threat. Number 1 is capacity, Number 2 is intent. The Flood was not an obstacle. I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles, for survival. Always remember, meet me in Denver. Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center. Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes. Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time. I perform a requiem on the Eve before Hip Hop ends. Oprah Winfrey don\'t like rap. All I got to say about that is "She probably don\'t like Black". I don\'t blame her, she don\'t understand it\'s only entertainment. She probably wouldn\'t feel different if she wasn\'t famous. She traded places and her opinions started changing. As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages. That alone could make a person racist, if not racist with colour?. Then material wise how we treat each other. I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx. The ideas have come from God,. 1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs. I heard Hip Hop was dead, that\'s not fair. Who I talk to?, go he there Nasir. Poet Laureate Infinity. I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY. I procured a small piece of the treasure, collections from a former era. Dating back to forever, the warrior became protector. Quoted from the book of the law, I don\'t govern them. I summon them, speaking in tongues again. Started with a trumpet, woodwinds, strings, then the conductor brings the. Drums in, fingers trigger the drum kit. My mind dives deep beneath yours. No emcee could rhyme like this, there\'s no challenge. His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance. Judge me fairly, compare me. To Dante Alighieri\'s Purgatorio theory. We\'ll shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park. The whirlpool of gravity traps me. Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy. Negative time produces antigravity. Killing my health, killing myself. Rebuilding myself, nobody feel what I felt. Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield. Writing with a feathered quill, getting more ill. The woman who is there for, she will take care of you. With Nexium, Avodart, Lipitor, and Theraflu. Rap Music Profession Immunosuppressants. Murder, murder, murder, kill kill kill. Williams was real ill. An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal. Raptors, Comanches, STRYKERS, Cobras. Back at the TOC with GW PRESCOTT. I gotta spit \'til the story is told. We shouldn\'t keep fighting, the Earth is our home. If we destroy Mother Earth, where will we go?. Starving in destitution, Dying for retribution. Why would you wanna\' blow a hospital? You stupid?. Why would you not force yourself to make better music?. I control their movements with lariats. Quoting my favourite Inventor, "I see excitement coming". I raise my hand, lightening bolts stream from it. I see excitement coming, I see excitement coming. They say "we\'re divided" I say we\'re small minded. Right after I said it I moved to a small island. There was no contingency plan given to me. Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me. Swear your allegiance the tuition is free. To be a mini me version with minor abilities. 7.83 hertz from the Earth. If A is a success in life. Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt. If work equals X and play equals Y. Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth. Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing. By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing. The Pope shook, they ransacked Rome and burnt books. I ran back home to hide mine in the woods. Acupuncture point or plus, is not enough. I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough. The facts too acute to repute, or debate. My face, is a slim sleek gas mask shape. I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone. unacknowledged special access project. I spit at a thousand KIPS, kilo tons of pressure. Every letter is measured in such a way you will remember. December, 21st 2012. is the code. It was placed on the sunstone to puzzle them. Starting with some numbers, the code crackers start crunching. I better have some results by the months end. Deep Blue computes deeply and does it.

Long as it means that I can get old and post up. I used to be a typical winner. Living off the gratuity from delivering your dinner. Cause as a kid, I didn't consider.

Don't breathe until you formally know me. Won't leave? Better call authorities. But you don't tell an astronaut what to do. The turntables stole my heart. Burnt the paintbrush, broke it apart. I miss it, I might revisit. But I wasn't that good, I admit it, maybe you can't tell. But as a kid, I wanted to be Melle Mel. And later as a teenager I wanted to be LL. Del.

S'Yo, sometimes the road to the truth is, so elusive it\'s confusin. And reality becomes illusion. If I showed the masses where we was at or where we was goin. I\'d shatter the social balance of the world as we know it. I\'m talkin bout the grand deception, of 1947. When our souls were sold to the heavens. For technologically advanced weapons. Crystal enhanced, brain implants, and mind control methods. MJ-12 is not majestic. And the focal point of our problems on this planet are not domestic. You can accept it or be stupid and be a skeptic. And fail to recognize the secret society\'s deathwish. Ninety-seven percent of our Presidents were Masons. Responsible for launderin trillions of dollars from the nation. For the construction of underground military installations. Abductions and cattle mutilations. Experiments on human patients. Can take place in several subterranean bases. A hundred and fifty stories below a basement. With knowledge of genetic information. you need to fear science not Satan. Cause through the manipulation of certain biological agents. They create strange creations. Top secret special operations. Low frequency sounds and lasers, people like Carl Sagan. That didn\'t believe in the Drake equation. Were tryin to keep Western civilization on the need-to-know basis. Well you need to know that this is a game. And we\'re bein betrayed and played in the worst way. Tune in to channel zero. Yo, the holy script from Genesis 1-26. Says, "Let us make man in our image under our likeness". First of all who\'s THEY? You see if God. Was truly a single entity that\'s not what he would say. We as the Elohim, Gods and Goddesses. Posess a marvelously monsterous subconscious. Lifeforms that speak, in very high pitched sounds and squeaks. Short staccato clicks and beeps. A highly advanced form of speech. Even though to us it seems like they only chatterin they teeth. They used to swim deep in the oceans beneath. Til they fins transformed into limbs and they started to creep. Then they evolved into mammals with feet. And walked right from the shorelines onto the beach. They used gravity, cause it\'s actually the only force around. That could slow time and the speed of light down. The energy grid network, opened the gateway from Earth. To any point in the universe. Livin organisms and various, geomagnetic gravitational, anomaly areas. Space expedition teams in the lunar regions. Reported seein, decapyramids and tetrahedrons. Liquid filled shoes, is what they used. To walk across the moon without leavin a clue. Of where they been for the past twenty-three billion years. Before life on the surface even appeared. I hope you become aware what I\'m spittin in your ear. Was intended to stimulate your left-brain\'s hemisphere. I know it sounds weird, all these motherfuckin answers. And questions to the grand deception. '

I'll put your whole crew in the hospital with IVs all in their nostrils. Stop sleeping on me, I ain't a mattress. Put you through more drama than a soap opera actress. Don't even think about pulling out and opening fire. Gunshots wound but I remove bullets with pliers. From a far side, that's even confusing the fat lip. Rhymes designed from lines of pure knowledge. I'll make your head nod 'til your neck runs out of cartilage. I think it's obvious that I can bring the ruckus. Scream on your crew like a military drill instructor.

Four bars from me would probably kill your whole catalog. Sixteen would make Deborah Lee cut the channel off. Thirty-two would make Paul Bunyan take the flannel off. Sixty-four would make your mama want sixty more. I eat haters, check the crumbs on my kitchen floor. They say my music?s pop. I call it buyin' cribs for my mama,. shakin' hands with Obama.

S'Space was full. Energy was consumed. There was a girl emphasis on the "L". She was noticin the detail as well. And the two of us found something with each other. Previously undiscovered. Hell is full of lovers. And the daylight is bright always makes me squint. But it feels like magic when it touches my face. Suffocate myself. Overwhelm myself. And let the sunrays abandon me floatin through space. And she still wonders why I\'m so insecure. She giggles because I sleep with a body pillow. Intentions are never nothing short of pure. But theres a price to pay when you try to live a little. And attractive as that napkin ever could\'ve been. My how it unfolded - hold it to the wind. Try now to be a rock but she\'s caught under the skin. Ex-lover and a best friend. Just like the rest of them. I stopped to watch someone bite the tip of a cigarette. To hold it inbetween her lips. Never met nobody like her please brace yourself. Danger danger. This might hurt. The playground feels a lot different when the sun\'s out. Screamin bout the ocean. Never knew punk rock could be so pretty. And sit by the phone so you can catch the call. Write catchy one-liners on the bathroom stall. Here I go wouldn\'t you know. Still learnin to crawl. Your tattoos intimidate men. I guess I\'m one of them. Then there was this one night I noticed a tree. That stood by itself about an hour up north. And I can picture her holding onto the limb. Wearin a summer dress and a grin. Swingin back and forth. Talkin bout the breeze and how it easy it is. To leave all the worries in the backseat. Just a pair of ears some strong fingers. And someone to share the tears. And I still get to talk to you every now and then. Definition of "over" doesn\'t have to be the end. It\'s good to see you grow girl. Shake my hand. That\'s all I want from my ex-lover and my best friend. I got your back. Don\'t ever fucking question that. I got your back. Always have. I still got your back. '

So scram, there\'s no more love for the kid. So I turned my head down and walked away from the crib. Loved so many times. I\'ve been alone so long. Had to pull myself together. Find my heart a brand new home. Got a good thing goin\' on. Can\'t let you mess with my flow. Too little, too late. (Gone for 9 years like 9 months to a child). (Where\'s my boo at? I need to see Bamboo). Love don\'t live here no more. Love don\'t live here no more. It\'s like that?. Okay then where you put all my stuff at then?. I done came home, you got another man, you know what. Oh word, so you over it? That\'s absurd. I never did a damn thing to deserved it. This is a man\'s world, I go away come home lookin\' for you. Now you fuckin\' up the plans, girl. You another man\'s girl, that ain\'t kosher. Once you see the kid\'s face you\'re supposed to. Drop what you\'re doin\', show your loyalty and love.

On the beaten path with a bandaged fist. To represent the last half of the damn I give. Millennium Dodo, drive with a limp. Flannel, look like a farmer. Underneath camo, look like a hunter. With that ski mask, look like a robber. Got stories to wax, pour me a glass. I run with the ghosts of warriors past. Y'all catch frostbite waiting at a stoplight. All over the map we get festive. Then cross to Mexico to see my dentist. "

S'Way before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint. The origin of a thievery leader will take place. Two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler. Grapple a refrigerator, gaffle a Nilla Wafer. And no role model provoke him to shift focus. Cause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it\'s stolen. Kids got the darnedest quirks. So 11\'s arms skip jars for his momma\'s purse. And bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn. Which he kept in a box in the yard. And the bark isn\'t carved from. klepto. But a klepto-tangent prefaced the grand canvas. Dance to the dirge, stand up. Celebrate the natural need to own what ain\'t earned. See it rolls off the tongue. smoke ring. rolls off a lung \'til it\'s done. Ready, set, kept petty theft on a post-it. Later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit. "Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!". Did you foreplay the GM,. carpe the diem. Whore play the porn game, fornicate the sure way to freedom. Or correlate with the swordplay and heathens?. Trickery and backtalk, fresh outta high school. On the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule. Every last number in its history. Got is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory. bathe in a bottle of your finest. Tackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds. \'Fore the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate. Get your money from the richest, seek your pussy from the flyest. Slow and low, do or die calm,. suicide king in the tuck of the palm. Slow and low, do or die stuck,. two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk. And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you. And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you. And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you.... (Capture the flag). (Capture the flag). (Capture the flag). One by one like little confused penguins. Larceny\'s yes-men. ooze for used weapons. Like a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat. Is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing. Nope, gotta configure the five finger. So the hot-wired vehicular skill is applicable. If an eye\'s on the prize and the itch ain\'t flushed. I hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush, like. Step on the abysmal cusp. Then incubate the mutt baby through his stigma\'s crutch. Like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums. Shoplift quicker than your shutter speed, click!. Missed, he dipped with dumb cutlery. Skip around the money pillar. And a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me. It go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed. The seed\'s all growns up playing grown people games. Evil aims grown, encompass the whole steeple chase. Grip, mitigate the master plan. So when the workers are asleep, riffraff expands. Yes a pig is a cop, but gotta fill up the flock. So when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies\'ll watch. I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked. Cause opportunity\'s fickle, after it trickle it stop. drag that crass little bastard. Flat through the hazmat glass. Laugh when he ask for it back. Welcome to the magic in a basket of cash. (Capture the flag). (Capture the flag). (Capture the flag). (Capture the flag). (Cap-cap-capture the flag). '

S'Pushing my way to the top but this time it feel different. DC ain\'t been this hot since Ronald Reagan made a killing. Ambition mixing liquor with life\'s lemons. Despite my dark days I feel I\'m the brightest of thinkers. Frequently hated, either that or misunderstood. But a wise woman told me "it\'s okay to know you good". They call it arrogance but I think it\'s passionate. And I think this happens when you rap and don\'t exaggerate. Shawty open your soul, pray that protools agree though. Me and my pupils is mutual they not focused as me though. See my flow is the nicest and my ho is the baddest. And the sex will lock her down see my stick is the gavel. Catalog growing, rappers skedaddle move over. She reluctantly fucking, she\'s an adamant blower. I\'m a passionate poet, moonlight as rapping Folarin. Horse is missing on my Polo cause my tag is enormous. I ain\'t cocky I\'m just proud of me. So why these niggas acting like I ain\'t allowed to be. ...Fuck you. When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room. Nigga, fuck you. yeah, just you. Tell them people we ain\'t leaving go adjust dude. Real nigga, pardon whoever feel different. How I grow to be 5\'8. But it\'s still my little niggas. Chanel slippers on my bitches like you go love. And I love your brain but I think I\'ll never know enough. Argue with twitter niggas who insignificant. But its just simply my interest to intricately ridicule niggas. Proud of it all defensive fuck I\'m rocking alone. Say what you want I\'m Immature like Roger go home. Hard headed hot headed I admit it. But I\'ll be damned if they defeat me like a fucking prosthetic. Rozay told me break a leg no wonder why I care again. Stunting in a pair of Tiffs I don\'t mean a pair of Tims. Two bitches named Tiffany. OD\'d on that Mitchell-Ness you thought it was \'03 again. Hold up yea we the best. Roll wit Ace, Khaled and them. Roll up niggas. weed like sex. Don\'t you leave a seed in there. Reading shit my critics say. Pitchfork doesn\'t need a plate. Not hungry for my poetry. They fasting they won\'t leave me ate. Six and a half, Optimistic this isnt bad. It\'s different now, Before the faith niggas was "WHAM". Carelessly whispering all they nickel opinions at me. Tell all my haters call they neighbor get they minions at me. A couple labels threw some millions yet they still ain\'t grab me. Nigga\'s talk they\'d attacked me but wouldn\'t steal a taxi. Ha, and I ain\'t smug I\'m just proud of me. Why they acting like a nigga ain\'t allowed to be. Ambition is definitely on the way. Eleven One Eleven. '

No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw. And if you ain?t had enough. What in the fat fishes. Of a phenomenal, Fahrvergn?gen fuck, is going on?. Back with the B.A Baracus, callous bang, on another song. I?mma have these niggas nervous, and clipping they nails and dribbling. And witness them,. nibble them, like sunflower seed shells. Set these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales. And I shit on these males, ?til it\'s stinkin\' fouler, than a weed smell. Nigga, your tree fell,. see how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email?. Talking I\'m sick,. I got them shook and I Bang \'em at retail. Until they cripple,. see I cook, like I?m. Slanging a weed sale, until I triple bread, and whoop ?em and  -. Drag \'em, like females (Sfu-ahe! Gasp!). Oh, see well. These niggas already know the way that I fuck shit up, minus the details. The case is shut, your bitch remind me of replacement, but. Kind of an ancient slut,. it\'s going down, like she was a basement fuck. Swell up this shit, like I?m sticking steaks in they gut. So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up. Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking, like apes in the cut. I?m waiting for the taking, while I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!). It?s kinda like, me having a case in the truck. And drinking ?til I?m blasted, harassing and erase a nigga (WHAT!). And got ?em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck. While I?m chasing a buck,. these funny niggas be chasing they luck. I be lacing them up, like boots when I?m pushing they face in the mud -. (Ahgah!). Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire,. ?til this shit. Circling back around,. with more fire for me to melt a brick. Surfacing back a sound,. while I light up shit that\'ll cause a quick. Worship and. gather around, it\'s. certain this shit\'ll splatter cliques. Painful and make ?em scatter (Blink!) Shameful, the way I shatter (Split!). Shit apart, it doesn\'t matter (Rip!).

Apparently, there\'s a light contagiousness to this tirade, It just might make you sick. So irate, with this my brain is just, like a fucking fried egg. Is my mind scrambled? Cause I\'m lit, narrow minded,. but go through. Such a wide range of this emotion, that my rage has gotta squeeze through it. Sideways - I just pulled up, in Clive Davis\'s driveway. With his personal memoir, saying "He\'s bi!",. waving a nine. A picket sign, egging his ride, making him cry "Rape!",. then arrive naked. And drive straight, through the gay pride parade, "Yippee-Ki-Yay!". Cause here I - wait, did the world just pee on my leg?. And should I take it as a sign, maybe to take \'em back into time? (Shady!). I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave em the finger. To take the attention away from my stinking face, it was bringing. Changed the whole complexion of the game, but just in case you was thinking. An inkling, of replacing the kingpin of crazy, you\'re wasting your ink then. So if this is any indication, of what you maybe facing. You better make a distinction, cause you fake imitations. Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression. That\'s the worst impersonation I\'ve ever seen,. who raps nasally. Eyes hazely, rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may need. Some Flonase when he\'s speaking? What kind of stupid question -  Is that?. "Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, other than your husband\'s. Fucking brains that were leaking, how\'d you think that play was this weekend?. You ain\'t the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down. Faggot, see me on a ballot? I\'m running for class clown. Rich Democrat, bitch, so I\'m just a candidate. To come fuck up the whole party, me and Flipmode starting a campaign. To have every campus, on a fucking rampage,. act, my goddamn age?. I am eight, so let\'s get smashed. and wake. Up the next day, with the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids. Glass ashtray smashed, champagne splashed on the lampshades. But this ain\'t up for debate, this is undebatable. Shady for president, ho don\'t make me go take it back. To the days of old,. with Sway & Tech radio, when I was taking. So much NoDoz and LSD, I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show. Fuck you telling me, fools? I was rippin\' shop. Raisin\' hell up in Drew\'s, when Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs. Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet. You\'re fucking with vets dawg,. fucking internet bloggers. "I sit in front of my computer all day and comment on everything. I\'m an expert on everything, everything sucks, play the next song". Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick. With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I\'d be dead wrong. Son of God. I\'m the S.O.G., like a wet log. Pores never get clogged,. cuz I\'m so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog. Yes, yes y?all (Y\'all!). Steady on the left, y?all,. step off, \'fore you get stepped on, Soft?. \'Bout as commercial, as my fucking Lear jet,. jealously?ll get. You as green as a Chia Pet,. I can see that you?re visibly upset, dawg. Alert, alert, girl, alert. Once you enter in my house of pain, you\'re in a world of hurt. So "Jump around! Jump, jump!" Get that ass shaking. "Jump around! Jump,. came to hit you, with a fan favorite. But if you too fly for coach, better get them arms and freaking hands flailing. And "Jump" like Van Halen, and pray for a damn tailwind. More afraid of success, than I am of failure. So what does that tell ya?. That on a grand scale. I don?t give a fuck about nothing, like Stan mailing. His last piece of fan mail, before he ran straight into the damn railing. [Outro]. Yo, chill, man! CHILL!. '

S'Peace to Jack Tripper. Wellstone bumper stickers. My name is Sean and I never had dreadlocks. Instead I got an army full of women screaming Headshots!. I guess that explains it, don\'t it. She started to make a mark but it came apart. That\'s what you get for tryin\' to make your little sister eat the kitty litter. Let\'s watch a rapper get bitter like the city winter. What the fuck you thinkin\'!?. You frustrated or something? Did you have a bad week?. Man, you got issues, I feel sorry for you. Yo, shitting on me is so 2002 (Bitch!). Turn your mic off, and turn the lights off. Whoever put your record out must have needed write-offs. Who they play when the game\'s in a tight spot?. Slug, you can find me in the A\'s of your iPod. Watch out!. When the crowd gets loud. It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down. Watch out!. When you open up your mouth. I can smell that you don\'t know what you\'re talking about. We all love a clown. But we don\'t wanna se you climb up out the underground. Watch out!. If you don\'t like the sound. Fuck you! I\'m just tryin\' to put it down for my home town. Cars drive by with the booming system. I must be getting old cause the bass sounds ridiculous. And nowadays, every body\'s biting 2Pac. So fuck it, I\'mma stand over here and do the moonwalk. Besides police, I\'ve got no beef. Just me, my beliefs and my bad teeth. A cargo van and some Ant beats. Enough rap to slap you to last week. Caught between the vice and the advice. Drunk, walking out in traffic just to fly kites. Time out, the free-style rhyme out, my last rights. Fuck a classic album, give my life 5 mics. And when the smoke clears, you won\'t be able to suck dick. Like you did as a teenage slut trick. And with a mat on his grill, he asks "Who the fuck are you?". Don\'t worry man, someday I\'ma be nobody too. Look, I understand your hate. When I was younger, I wanted to be LL Cool J. Then he started making records for the girls and shit. So I ripped up the Kangol and threw it away. I stole moves from KRS-One. A little Big Daddy Kane and some DJ Run. And then we took our life and made it a song. And look, nowadays Rhymesayers is on. It\'s the B-I-G D-A double D-Y S-E-A-N. He hasn\'t hit the rooftop to jump, guess he waitin\'?. For what? I don\'t know, but who wanna come with me?. I got at least one more tool with me. So criticize me, or idolize me. Study from a distance or stand right beside me. It don\'t matter, just act like I know. And watch your back on the beat. Or get sacked at the free throw. '

S'It\'s livin\' a pathological lie to deny that I\'m nice. And the truth hurts (ow). Wearin\' a blue shirt the best buy for the price. To get six guys this live and nice on the mic. So don\'t diss us because we\'re fly. Until you try what it\'s like. I\'m liable to slice at these emcee bastards. Leaving their knees fractured. Needin\' every piece of their teeth re-crafted [Do it to \'em]. So don\'t front cause I see past it. You\'re harmless like Wolverine\'s adamantium claws. When they\'re retracted [ching*]. For three nanoseconds [damn]. Count your paces, one step to Tonedeff. You\'re Gone in Sixty Seconds like Nicholas Cage is. I\'ll leave you riddled with basics. There\'s no need for complexity. To be beside myself I need God next to me. Just kiddin\'. I\'m partially bullshittin\'. The only time I take a loss pussy is when I lose kittens. I pitch shit past \'ya, no matter who\'s hittin\'. I don\'t capsize boats. But I got crews flippin\'. You catch it? The message needs analyzation. Step and your boys\'ll be pouring alcoholic libations. I flew sick, you knew this. Fuck mentally. Stretch you into a physical Rubik\'s. It\'ll take more than sticker rearrangement to change it. His language is so strange, how do we contain it?. You can\'t just paint this up upon the canvas. Gotta get the mental picture. To begin to understand this. I\'m giving body language speech impediments. Each uttered threat causes confident cats to stutter-step. Cut a reputation down to a sighs too raw for porn overdubs. A jaded wordsmith bleeding ghostwriter\'s pens dry. Getting on a rapper\'s nerves, corroding dendrites. Seems I gave cats ADATs the way they make tracks. Society of Nimh. Indie Pennant. then I\'ll bus your clique to Rikers. Can\'t relax, man, the last time I took a breather. I got brought up on murder charges. I\'m so nice Mr. Rogers sued my ass. For copyright infringement. From wanna be thugs to 24/7 bitch kids. Switch my style? Who you tryin\'a play?. My beats\'ll maraud yo\' ass any time of day. Like Deuce Bigalow\'s chick. Whenever you do shit. People see you and holler "That\'s one huge bitch!". Shit, when the LP rolls out. The Source\'ll be forced to make the quotables. A three-page fold-out. Bombin\' the next kid wearin\' Abercrombie and Fitch. pulled out of rotation like a Firestone radial. Not even my winner\'s belt keeps my jeans from saggin\'. It seems I\'m braggin\'. But fiends been naggin\' for my next release. I apply all my expertise and make \'em extra pleased. Even get the vexed appeased, I make any brother feel this. All I do is independent, like double helix. Sellin\' out? Well I hope that you\'re not. But how else could you afford all the soap that you drop?. Takin\' me out ain\'t no small feat, you ain\'t Bigfoot. You should know who the heck you\'re facin\'. Cause my reputation leaves no room for speculation. Now battle, is that you want to do?. What kind of man are you?. I bet you sit on the urinal too. NIMH got your heart skippin\' beats like acapellas. I be a cryptic author. Writing poems on tombstones. Celph-Titled, the nigga you couldn\'t bring home. I\'m at the crib wit your bitch givin\' me slow head. Split you up in more pieces than when Jesus broke bread. My clique is raw, be prepared when you meet us. Kill an unborn baby and you still couldn\'t. de-fetus. I don\'t battle with rhymes. I\'d rather battle with nines. Instead of using my mind. I\'d rather shatter your spine. The closest you ever came to a punch line. Was waitin\' for refreshments at the prom in \'89. Fuckin\' bitches with super asscheeks. I beat a bitch until her whole body turn to cleavage. I\'m hyperactive so I drink decaffinated. My left jab is fatal, leavin\' cats decapitated. '

Devolved into mothmen munching textiles. Punisher, out past go-time. Back 10 fried worms chubbier. Brown grass both sides. Canned food, . manmade tools. Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root. Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes. And a handshake-proof campaign, can?t lose. Can?t gain. Smoke out moles like a force of nature. Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly. Maybe in the form of a nest egg. Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray. Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate. Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day. M-m-moral compass all batshit. Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets. Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict. I mean, I guess it matters to me, I wish it mattered to you. How a thousand virtues. Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles. Roving packs of elusive young become. Choke-lore writers over boosted drums. In the terrifying face of a future tongue. Down down from a huntable surplus to one. (Check his own) Breakneck pulse over colors in a drain. That emote sugar skulls in the rain. Flower-eyes melting. Guided by a levee made of bath tiles, . tilting. Quarter up and headed for the kill screen. No corner cut, no build team. Only a particularly menacing. Angle perpendicular to everything. Boys room cherry bomb. Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron. Hello! . Here?s where a tale of caution. Pounds coffin nails . to bootlegs of Hawkwind. Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold. Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles. Arm in the maw. Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall. A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause. Get stuffed with cartoon cigars. Cold pack, . neti-pot, . home to roost. Around folk backed into what they most lampoon. Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles. Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you. Fade me, . failed all basic training. But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling. Silhouette, .

Now suck that skinny white pimp dick, suck it. First thing you wake up to: your pimp. Don\'t forget to pay up to: your pimp. Get that money, give it here. He\'ll keep a bitch in that stable for 50 years. He ain\'t scared of the law or the cops. Got them paid off, some kind of trade off. Gonna stay in the pocket. As long as the money stays long and the hands stay strong. He\'s right there in your clothes and hair. You never gonna let him in your home. I can smell his breath on this microphone.

So I settle for selling my soul to the slaves of the land of the free. I don't wanna leave my family tree behind. I don't want no one to miss me like I miss you. The soldier is a dreamer and a realist. And history sealed this. Taught me that a hero ain't nothing but a field trip. Put a stick in the ground to prove you was around. No amount of time will ever be considered enough. I'm trying to tether it up and live forever through love. We're not lucky, but we're fortunate. I'm pretty sure of it.

S'Walking down my ex-block, the block Monroe. I said, peace to her, the girl said hello. Well hell is low and the lowest you can go. Is thirty-two degrees, below zero. So I started to rain on this young girl\'s brain. Causin her a great mass of physical pain. She said, "Tit for tat, step off my bra strap. No diamonds, no gold, you cannot get a rap.". Then I said, "So what?", as I grabbed her butt. She smiled for a while but her mouth kept shut. The girl is eighteen, just birthed a child. You\'re young in the brain and your thoughts are wild. You\'re on welfare, yo but you don\'t care. You say, "FTF is always there.". Yes FTF meaning face-to-face. The main headquarters of your local place. Where you collect your bi-weekly pay. To support the foolish habits you abuse everyday. There has never been a dame in my entire life. My girlie, my ex, my next or my wife. There has never been one who tried to disrespect. Especially a member of the opposite sex. But I don\'t want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth. Silly girls, they think guys are soft. But all they wanna do, is knock their boots off. And just from obtaining the common sense. You can tell that the girlies seem rather quite dense. Other than dense they play slightly bold. But from the statements I made they could not uphold theyself. They break down, and they start to cry and said. "Oh! I don\'t believe this guy!". "It\'s all about the finances" "Forget the romance". "Guys with cash" "can rock my big a--". Silly girls on a strip, struttin back and forth. Watchin cars, thinkin of G\'n off. Lookin for gentlemen, who they might swing. And attitudes, like you can get anything. You wear tight bodysuits under long coats. But ain\'t satisfied until a pervert slice your throat. You\'re young you\'re dumb and you used to be innocent. When young, now take a look at what you\'ve become. A bloodsucker, trying to get all you can. Out the pocket of thenext girl\'s man. Just to clothe yourself in gold and jewelry. You wear tight jeans with attempts to lure me. Into your web, cause you\'re livin like a spider. And playin it off, like everything\'s Ore-Ida. You come out late at night and roam the streets. Like thiefs, stalkin a piece of flesh meat. Is that what you do for a living get paid?. C\'mon, there\'s plenty of ways to get paid. But instead of living the life that\'s clean and sturdy. You\'d rather go out and get your knees dirty. "And some Fendi too". First of all, don\'t leave home without it. Without what?. The gold card. I\'m tryin to tell you now. I don\'t lay on my back for free. You know as they say. If you wanna Taney. Ya gots ta pay. I got a new Yugo. You go, get in your Yugo. And get on out of here!. I don\'t believe him, he got champagne thoughts and Bud Light money. Benz\'s. Forget about the love it\'s all about the money. So let\'s go put on our silk suits and step to the club tonight. That\'s where it\'s at. Yeah, money. '

This is reality mane. Ain't no surprise I've been bangin' without any mane. What is this gotta be brave. When into the night I'm going to go quietly mane. Life is a bitch and then you live. Until one day by death you're found. I tried to keep both of my feet on the ground. But I know my head is surrounded by clouds. Spirallin' down, destined to drown. Forever is just a collection of nows. Off on my own, nowhere is my home. Approaching infinity's fork in the road. When I was young something I often was told. It's not a bargain if it costs you your soul. Costs you your pride, caution aside. I'm gone with the wind and along for the ride. Wish I could rest and open my eyes. But time ain't finna fly down from the sky. A place where the lonely love. Not another soul's there, only us. I woke with a tear drop. All I know is what I know. I woke with a tear drop.

Yes, . you could tell me how hard you had it. And you could show me all the scars to back it. And we can analyze each complaint. Break it down and explain these mistakes I make. I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry. But you knew me back when I was a younger me. You've seen Sean in all types of light. And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright. Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you. Strange things my imagination might do. Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through. Or am I just going crazy ?cause I miss you?. I'm shook, I know . I pushed when I should have pulled. Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul. And I would make a top notch good listener. If you could block off a little time out to give it here. Since we went our separate paths. I've hit a couple of snags . that remind me of the past. I can't front, I'm having a blast. But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last. Sitting here wishing we could kick it. Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms. I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit. I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen. But who am I jokin' with?. There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it. It doesn't matter, this is more than love.

Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through. Or am I just going crazy ?cause I miss you?. And when you left, I didn't see it coming. I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running. You crept out the front door slow. And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know. And by the the time I looked up, it was booked up. Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff. A whole house full of dreams and steps. I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept. You disappeared, but the history is still here. That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer. I can't even get mad that you're gone. Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me. I'm sorry, it's official. I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple. Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins. Had so much hatred now it brings me shame. Never thought about the world without you. And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you. I thought I saw you yesterday. But I know it wasn't you, ?cause you passed away, . Dad. [Hook]. Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you. Strange things my imagination might do.

Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts. The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness. Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus. And so on. I\'ve thrown long Hail Mary bombs. Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics. Life treats the peasants like. They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside. Well they\'re merely chasing perfectionist emblems. When the clock strikes nine. I\'ll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players. For the cycle of it. Under a dusted angel heart string Big Brother is watching. My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk. talking stealth. We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts. We on some door-to-door now. Order ten dollars or more, we\'ll shove it down your throat for free. I\'ll sacrifice my inborn tendencies. For copper pennies for one commanding "Gimme that". So we can retain baby fat. Make the biter snake bedlam. Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet. Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon. Bent barrel one eight zero, you\'ll turn, squeeze, end it. It\'s on like it\'s never been. It\'s bleeding well. It\'s bigger than a breadbox. It corrodes my leaky finance. I\'ll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge. With a Coke and a bag of chips. To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because. The first one slipped. Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks. I tend to underestimate my average. Just another bastard savage. Someday you\'ll all eat out of my cold hand. Cuz every dog has its day. At which point, I\'ll pull it away. Now we the American working population. Hate the fact that eight hours a day. Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn\'t us. And we may not hate our jobs. But we hate jobs in general. That don\'t have to do with fighting our own causes. We the American working population. Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out. When we\'d rather be supporting ourselves. By being paid to perfect the pastimes. That we have harbored based solely on the fact. That it makes us smile if it sounds dope. It\'s the year of the silkworm. Everything I built burned yesterday. Let\'s display the purpose that these stilts serve. Elevate the spreading of the silk germ. Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead. Nah brother, it\'s the year of the jackal. Saddle up on high horse. My torch forced Polaris embarrassed. Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage. I bought some new sneakers. I just hope my legacy matches. It\'s the year of the landshark. Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water. They\'re out there being slaughtered. In meaningless wars so you don\'t have to bother. And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters. Man it\'s the year of the Orphan. Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches. Trying to guard the fortress of a king they\'ve never seen or met. But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat. Maybe it\'s the year of the waterbug. Cockroach utter thug specimen.

And we may not hate our jobs. But we hate jobs in general. That don\'t have to do with fighting our own causes. We the American working population. Hate the nine to five day-in day-out. But we\'d rather be supporting ourselves. By being paid to perfect the pastimes. That we have harbored based solely on the fact. That it makes us smile if it sounds dope. Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen. Pour myself a cup of ambition and. Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and. If I never make it home today, God bless.

S"I keep fallin', who let my hopes rise?. No parachute to provide safety, take me. Away from this shallow tide, from the shallow minds. The walls keep closin' in, I've opened every door. The hinges just always squeak. I need to loosen up, put it all behind me. lost is where you'll find me. October 27th, 1995. The day I found out my sister was no longer alive. Now I'm the oldest sibling. With her no longer living on this sad day. Decided to give up the bad ways. And to be a model for my younger sister. But my education was just car heists, burglury, urban liqour. The sort of fingers being curved on triggers. And I knew for certain, if I continued, living life all simple. Jail would be the only institution I'd be able to get into. So I laced by boots. Hit the books, flip from crook. Music became my medication. Motivation for meditation. Far better than any perscription my man was makin'. If things never changed, then she could be beside me. But I discard the hypothetics. Won't let stress slice my lettuce. Theoreticaly, she just moved on ahead of me. Occassionally flames took to pine. When I'm in binds I grab the Holy Book to find. A revelation to raise me out of this mental mess. And remember my life being blessed. Isn't coincidentalness. A simple test we face daily can drive us crazy. Got somebody on my soul's shoulder lookin' over me. "

S"My nourishment's provided in the summer. So then I wonder how y'all chasing dreams when what's tangible still outruns you!. Hail dirty doll immaculate performance. Warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what I'm born in. Cut and paste alertness to current settings provided quick. Shimmy the pirate ship mass, spot the island, sound the siren. And about face. Let's salute the embraced pertinent generals. Who turned innocent hermits to burning spectacles. Flirtin' with a serpent working overtime. drain the battery. Siphon the poison to flood his majesty's hatchery. I was riding on a yellow bus to where the brush thickens. And it ain't exactly plush pickings. I'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge. I've ever crossed. beneath the sun. Than live my life knowing you may one day follow me over one. Snake bite, breath too heavy to hold. Caught up in the wake of the red witch trying to swim it. Ran for the sake of dead cliques stripped of idyllic image. Steal a sloppy earth meal. Feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision. Thrill, trucking with a bucket of pennies. I'm 'a drag my sneakers through the dirt like alligator bellies 'til the cloud burst. Honor and a loud thirst submersed in a trap. Little drummer boy vs. thunderclap. In a city of garbage, trying to reap the harvest. Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest. Swing your little ax or be an oak tree if you can't. Either way; adapt to circumstance or play your final hand. You don't know enigma. An attempt to bury the hatchet rendered me victim of deviltry. Plus wounded like stigmatics. Something's huffing hazardous. I smell an inch of difference in this morning's pollution pistons. And how the loose ends drifted. My sour patch institution slipped in amidst the invaders and pardon my tone. But this garden's grown fucking acres since my visit. Itching to count the layers in the blizzard. 'Til that chapter where my family inserts the dagger and twists it. It's a carnival. Have you any sweets for my weary kin? It's a carnival. Have you any feed for my cheery grin? It's a carnival. Welcome, play our games, you'll never win. 'Cuz it's that carnival where every freak show spectacle's your friend. And I'm a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas. Anti-freeze to glacier. cookin' a look of fiery nature. It's the ceiling feeling too heavy to bliss the I-beams for a fraction more. Collapsed and left 'I'm sorry' tacked to you door. Pitching my back to hell's kitchen. Back burner murder machinery released regardless of the pardons. Hitching my life to the leash of one minstrel. Sick of same window different visual. Same agnostic hostage different ritual. Plague, cooperative super colony clash. I heard you got a dust collection, lemme see it. I duel as underdog vs. forced adaptation to the marvels of the now. Since then, my knuckles haven't once dragged on the ground. [OUTRO]. The ritual goes, same window different visual. "

Me against my self, I fight the Grim Reaper. Swing sickle, I got my Glock bust rounds off. Demented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you. Angels waste the time, they work together. Scheme and plot on me, cause I\'m the son of man. I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam. I kill all my enemies, cause I love company. Those who seek me, are called wise men.

For any fan of the limelight. In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite. It\'s risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale. With rappers who\'s better off on the cover of Black Tail. Jumpin Jehosaphat, who\'s that?. Who cats who do magic be like "tell me how you do\'s that". Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko. Thought I might do techno. Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet. For no reason he get cussed out like Tourettes. Yet tight flow to make her bad-ass stutter. Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter. Butter, word play. Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage". Benny Hill. sip Henny straight, get every penny weighed, then he chill, at any rate. Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing. Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting. And the super-villain strike again like lightning. In the same spot (bzzz!) now what\'s the chance of that?. That\'s a no jiver from the, liver conniver. Who vote players out the rap game like Survivor while I. And spin on your back and then freeze. While I play high-ball. low-ball, to zero. So called rhymers, go call Cleo. Ortho-TriCylin. Sometimes the men, mostly from the women. I hear voices saying that\'s the super-villain. (Uhh, I hear voices). Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain. '
